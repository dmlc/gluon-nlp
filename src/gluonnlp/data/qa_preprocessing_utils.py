    # The SQuAD annotations are character based. We first project them to
    # whitespace-tokenized words. But then after WordPiece tokenization, we can
    # often find a "better match". For example:
    #
    #   Question: What year was John Smith born?
    #   Context: The leader was John Smith (1895-1943).
    #   Answer: 1895
    #
    # The original whitespace-tokenized answer will be "(1895-1943).". However
    # after tokenization, our tokens will be "( 1895 - 1943 ) .". So we can match
    # the exact answer, 1895.
    #
    # However, this is not always possible. Consider the following:
    #
    #   Question: What country is the top exporter of electornics?
    #   Context: The Japanese electronics industry is the lagest in the world.
    #   Answer: Japan
    #
    # In this case, the annotator chose "Japan" as a character sub-span of
    # the word "Japanese". Since our WordPiece tokenizer does not split
    # "Japanese", we just use "Japanese" as the annotation. This is fairly rare
    # in SQuAD, but does happen.
