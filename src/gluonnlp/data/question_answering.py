    """Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) - reading comprehension dataset.

    From
    https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/

    License: CreativeCommons BY-SA 4.0

    The original data format is json, which has multiple contexts (a context is a paragraph of text
    from which questions are drawn). For each context there are multiple questions, and for each of
    these questions there are multiple (usually 3) answers.

    This class loads the json and flattens it to a table view. Each record is a single question.
    Since there are more than one question per context in the original dataset, some records shares
    the same context. Number of records in the dataset is equal to number of questions in json file.

    The format of each record of the dataset is following:

    - record_index:  An index of the record, generated on the fly (0 ... to # of last question)
    - question_id:   Question Id. It is a string and taken from the original json file as-is
    - question:      Question text, taken from the original json file as-is
    - context:       Context text.  Will be the same for questions from the same context
    - answer_list:   All answers for this question. Stored as python list
    - start_indices: All answers' starting indices. Stored as python list.
      The position in this list is the same as the position of an answer in answer_list

    Parameters

        Dataset segment. Options are 'train' and 'dev'.
    root : str, default '~/.mxnet/datasets/squad'
