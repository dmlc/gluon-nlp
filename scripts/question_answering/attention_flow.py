class AttentionFlow(gluon.HybridBlock):
    '''
    This ``block`` takes two ndarrays as input and returns a ndarray of attentions.

    We compute the similarity between each row in each matrix and return unnormalized similarity
    scores.  Because these scores are unnormalized, we don't take a mask as input; it's up to the
    caller to deal with masking properly when this output is used.

    By default similarity is computed with a dot product, but you can alternatively use a
    parameterized similarity function if you wish.


    Input:
        - ndarray_1: ``(batch_size, num_rows_1, embedding_dim)``
        - ndarray_2: ``(batch_size, num_rows_2, embedding_dim)``

    Output:
        - ``(batch_size, num_rows_1, num_rows_2)``

    Parameters
    ----------
    similarity_function: ``SimilarityFunction``, optional (default=``DotProductSimilarity``)
        The similarity function to use when computing the attention.
