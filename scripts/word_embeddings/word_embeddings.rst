Word Embedding Toolkit
----------------------
:download:`[Download] </scripts/word_embeddings.zip>`

Gluon NLP makes it easy to evaluate and train word embeddings. This folder
includes examples to evaluate the pre-trained embeddings included in the Gluon
NLP toolkit as well as example scripts for training embeddings on custom
datasets.


Word Embedding Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To evaluate a specific embedding on one or multiple datasets you can use the
included `evaluate_pretrained.py` as follows.


.. code-block:: console

   $ python evaluate_pretrained.py

Call the script with the `--help` option to get an overview of the supported
options. We include a `run_all.sh` script to run the evaluation for the
pretrained English Glove and fastText embeddings included in GluonNLP.

.. code-block:: console

   $ run_all.sh

The resulting logs and a notebook containing a ranking for the different
evaluation tasks are available `here
<https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/blob/master/gluonnlp/logs/embedding_results/>`__.


Word Embedding Training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides loading pretrained embeddings, the Gluon NLP toolkit also makes it easy
to train embeddings.

`train_word2vec.py` shows how to facilitate the embeddings related functionality
in the Gluon NLP toolkit to train Word2Vec word embedding models. Similarly
`train_fasttext.py` shows how to train an embedding model that facilitates
subword information.

Word2Vec models were introduced by

- Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, and Jeffrey Dean. Efficient estimation
  of word representations in vector space. ICLR Workshop , 2013.

FastText models were introudced by

- Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., & Mikolov, T. (2017). Enriching word
  vectors with subword information. TACL, 5(), 135â€“146.

We report the results obtained by running the `train_fasttext.py` script with
default parameters. You can reproduce these results with runningand `python
train_fasttext.py --gpu 0` respectively. For comparison we also report the
results obtained by training FastText with the `facebookresearch/fastText
implementation <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText>`_. All results are
obtained by training 5 epochs on the `Text8
<http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html>`_ dataset.

Loading of fastText models with subword information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fasttext models trained with the library of facebookresearch are exported both
in a text and a binary format. Unlike the text format, the binary format
preserves information about subword units and consequently supports computation
of word vectors for words unknown during training (and not included in the text
format). Besides training new fastText embeddings with Gluon NLP it is also
possible to load the binary format into a Block provided by the Gluon NLP
toolkit using `FasttextEmbeddingModel.load_fasttext_format`.
