THE DATA
There are three types of files:

.abstr: Contains the title and the abstract. When inspecting a file,
it should be clear how the title is separated from the abstract. Note,
however, that the title is sometimes longer than one line.

.contr: Contains the controlled manually assigned keywords, separated
with semicolon.

.uncontr: Contains the uncontrolled manually assigned keywords,
separated with semicolon. These are the keywords used in Hulth's
experiments.
