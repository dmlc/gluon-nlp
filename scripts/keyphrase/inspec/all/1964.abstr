Antipersistent Markov behavior in foreign exchange markets
A quantitative check of efficiency in US dollar/Deutsche mark exchange rates is
	developed using high-frequency (tick by tick) data. The antipersistent

	principle, the possibility of a statistical forecast. We introduce and
	measure the available information of the quote sequence, and we show
	how it can be profitable following a particular trading rule
