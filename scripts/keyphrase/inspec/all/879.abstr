Well behaved women rarely make history!
The author considers women in the history of computer science. Prior to the
	ENIAC, women were extremely important to the computing business as
	"computers". Just as women had taken over the tasks as secretaries in
	the late 1800s with the advent of the typewriter, and in the early
	1900s staffing telephone exchanges, so computing relied on women as the
	"workhorses" of the business
