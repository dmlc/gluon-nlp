Axioms for branching time
Logics of general branching time, or historical necessity, have long been
	studied but important axiomatization questions remain open. Here the
	difficulties of finding axioms for such logics are considered and ideas
	for solving some of the main open problems are presented. A new, more
	expressive logical account is also given to support Peirce's
	prohibition on truth values being attached to the contingent future
