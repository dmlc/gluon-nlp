An optimal control algorithm based on reachability set approximation and
	linearization
The terminal functional of a general control system is refined by studying an
	analogous problem for a variational system and regularization. A
	sequential refinement method is designed by combining the local
	approximation of the reachability set and reduction. The corresponding
	algorithm has relaxation properties. An illustrative example is given
