Cooperative three- and four-player quantum games
A cooperative multi-player quantum game played by 3 and 4 players has been
	studied. A quantum superposed operator is introduced in this work which
	solves the non-zero sum difficulty in previous treatments. The role of
	quantum entanglement of the initial state is discussed in detail
