Option pricing from path integral for non-Gaussian fluctuations. Natural
	martingale and application to truncated Levy distributions
Within a path integral formalism for non-Gaussian price fluctuations, we set up
	a simple stochastic calculus and derive a natural martingale for option
	pricing from the wealth balance of options, stocks, and bonds. The
	resulting formula is evaluated for truncated Levy distributions
