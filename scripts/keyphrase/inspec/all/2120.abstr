Control in active systems based on criteria and motivation
For active systems where the principal varies the agents' goal functions by
	adding to them appropriately weighted goal functions of other agents or
	a balanced system of inter-agent transfers, the paper formulated and
	solved the problems of control based on criteria and motivation. Linear
	active systems were considered by way of example
