The Internet, knowledge and the academy
As knowledge is released from the bounds of libraries, as research becomes no
	longer confined to the academy, and education/certification is
	available, any time/any place, the university and the faculty must
	redefine themselves. Liberal studies, once the core, and currently
	eschewed in favor of science and technology, will be reborn in those
	institutions that can rise above the mundane and embrace an emerging
	"third culture"
