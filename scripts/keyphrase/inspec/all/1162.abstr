Recognition of finite simple groups S/sub 4/(q) by their element orders
It is proved that among simple groups S/sub 4/(q) in the class of
	finite-groups, only the groups S/sub 4/(3/sup n/), where n is an odd
	number greater than unity, are recognizable by a set of their element
	orders. It is also shown that simple groups U/sub 3/(9), /sup 3/D/sub
	4/(2), G/sub 2/(4), S/sub 6/(3), F/sub 4/(2), and /sup 2/E/sub 6/(2)
	are recognizable, but L/sub 3/(3) is not
