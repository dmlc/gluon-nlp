Source/channel coding of still images using lapped transforms and block
	classification
A novel scheme for joint source/channel coding of still images is proposed. By
	using efficient lapped transforms, channel-optimised robust quantisers
	and classification methods it is shown that significant improvements
	over traditional source/channel coding of images can be obtained while
	keeping the complexity low
