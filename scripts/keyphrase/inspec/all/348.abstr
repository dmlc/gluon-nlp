Lower bounds on the information rate of secret sharing schemes with homogeneous
	access structure
We present some new lower bounds on the optimal information rate and on the
	optimal average information rate of secret sharing schemes with
	homogeneous access structure. These bounds are found by using some
	covering constructions and a new parameter, the k-degree of a
	participant, that is introduced in this paper. Our bounds improve the
	previous ones in almost all cases
