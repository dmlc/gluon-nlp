A generalized PERT/CPM implementation in a spreadsheet
This paper describes the implementation of the traditional PERT/CPM algorithm
	for finding the critical path in a project network in a spreadsheet.
	The problem is of importance due to the recent shift of attention to
	using the spreadsheet environment as a vehicle for delivering
	management science/operations research (MS/OR) techniques to end-users
