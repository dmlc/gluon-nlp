MEMS applications in computer disk drive dual-stage servo systems
We present a decoupled discrete time pole placement design method, which can be
	combined with a self-tuning scheme to compensate variations in the
	microactuator's (MA's) resonance mode. Section I of the paper describes
	the design and fabrication of a prototype microactuator with an
	integrated gimbal structure. Section II presents a decoupled
	track-following controller design and a self-tuning control scheme to
	compensate for the MA's resonance mode variations
