E-learning on the college campus: a help or hindrance to students learning
	objectives: a case study
If you know how to surf the World Wide Web, have used email before, and can
	learn how to send an email attachment, then learning how to interact in
	an online course should not be difficult at all. In a way to find out,
	I decided to offer two identical courses, one of which would be offered
	online and the other the "traditional way". I wanted to see how
	students would fare with identical material provided in each course. I
	wanted their anonymous feedback, when the course was over
