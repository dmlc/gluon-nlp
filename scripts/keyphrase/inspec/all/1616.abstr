Pitch post-processing technique based on robust statistics
A novel pitch post-processing technique based on robust statistics is proposed.
	Performances in terms of pitch error rates and pitch contours show the
	superiority of the proposed method compared with the median filtering
	technique. Further improvement is achieved through incorporating an
	uncertainty term in the robust statistics model
