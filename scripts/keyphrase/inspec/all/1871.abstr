Strong and weak points of the MUSCADET theorem prover-examples from CASC-JC
MUSCADET is a knowledge-based theorem prover based on natural deduction. It has
	participated in CADE Automated theorem proving System Competitions. The
	results show its complementarity with regard to resolution-based
	provers. This paper presents some of its crucial methods and gives some
	examples of MUSCADET proofs from the last competition (CASC-JC in IJCAR
	2001)
