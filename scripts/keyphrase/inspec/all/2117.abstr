The p-p rearrangement and failure-tolerance of double p-ary multirings and
	generalized hypercubes
It is shown that an arbitrary grouped p-element permutation can be implemented
	in a conflict-free way through the commutation of channels on the
	double p-ary multiring or the double p-ary hypercube. It is revealed
	that in arbitrary single-element permutations, these commutators
	display the property of the (p-1)-nodal failure-tolerance and the
	generalized hypercube displays in addition the property of the
	(p-1)-channel failure-tolerance
