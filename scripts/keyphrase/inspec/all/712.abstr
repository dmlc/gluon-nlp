Waiting-time distribution of a discrete-time multiserver queue with correlated
	arrivals and deterministic service times: D-MAP/D/k system
We derive the waiting-time distribution of a discrete-time multiserver queue
	with correlated arrivals and deterministic (or constant) service times.
	We show that the procedure for obtaining the waiting-time distribution
	of a multiserver queue is reduced to that of a single-server queue. We
	present a complete solution to the waiting-time distribution of
	D-MAP/D/k queue together with some computational results
