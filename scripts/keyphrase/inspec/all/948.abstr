Pairwise thermal entanglement in the n-qubit (n <or= 5) Heisenberg XX chain
We have calculated the concurrence of the pairwise thermal entanglement for the
	four-qubit and five-qubit Heisenberg XX chain. It is found that there
	is a great difference between the even-qubit and the odd-qubit chain in
	the aspect of the critical temperature and of the existence of the
	entanglement for the case of the qubit number n no more than 5
