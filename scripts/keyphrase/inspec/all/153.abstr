On the relationship between omega -automata and temporal logic normal forms
We consider the relationship between omega -automata and a specific logical
	formulation based on a normal form for temporal logic formulae. While
	this normal form was developed for use with execution and clausal
	resolution in temporal logics, we show how it can represent,
	syntactically, omega -automata in a high-level way. Technical proofs of
	the correctness of this representation are given
