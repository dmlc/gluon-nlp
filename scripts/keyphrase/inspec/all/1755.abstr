Theta functions with harmonic coefficients over number fields
We investigate theta functions attached to quadratic forms over a number field
	K. We establish a functional equation by regarding the theta functions
	as specializations of symplectic theta functions. By applying a
	differential operator to the functional equation, we show how theta
	functions with harmonic coefficients over K behave under modular
	transformations
