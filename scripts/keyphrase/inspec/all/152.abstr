Linear tense logics of increasing sets
We provide an extension of the language of linear tense logic with future and
	past connectives F and P, respectively, by a modality that quantifies
	over the points of some set which is assumed to increase in the course
	of time. In this way we obtain a general framework for modelling growth
	qualitatively. We develop an appropriate logical system, prove a
	corresponding completeness and decidability result and discuss the
	various kinds of flow of time in the new context. We also consider
	decreasing sets briefly
