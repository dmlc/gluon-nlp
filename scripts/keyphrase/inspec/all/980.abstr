Convergence of Runge-Kutta methods for nonlinear parabolic equations
We study time discretizations of fully nonlinear parabolic differential
	equations. Our analysis uses the fact that the linearization along the
	exact solution is a uniformly sectorial operator. We derive smooth and
	nonsmooth-data error estimates for the backward Euler method, and we
	prove convergence for strongly A (v)-stable Runge-Kutta methods. For
	the latter, the order of convergence for smooth solutions is
	essentially determined by the stage order of the method. Numerical
	examples illustrating the convergence estimates are presented
