Two-scale curved element method for elliptic problems with small periodic
	coefficients
This paper is concerned with the second order elliptic problems with small
	periodic coefficients on a bounded domain with a curved boundary. A
	two-scale curved element method which couples linear elements and
	isoparametric elements is proposed. The error estimate is obtained over
	the given smooth domain. Furthermore an additive Schwarz method is
	provided for the isoparametric element method
