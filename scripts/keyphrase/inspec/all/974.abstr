Extrapolation in Lie groups with approximated BCH-formula
We present an extrapolation algorithm for the integration of differential
	equations in Lie groups which is a suitable generalization of the
	well-known GBS-algorithm for ODEs. Sufficiently accurate approximations
	to the BCH-formula are required to reach a given order. We give such
	approximations with a minimized number of commutators
