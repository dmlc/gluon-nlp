Boolean operators and the naive end-user: moving to AND
Since so few end-users make use of Boolean searching, it is obvious that any
	effective solution needs to take this reality into account. The most
	important aspect of a technical solution should be that it does not
	require any effort on the part of users. What is clearly needed is for
	search engine designers and programmers to take account of the
	information-seeking behavior of Internet users. Users must be able to
	enter a series of words at random and have those words automatically
	treated as a carefully constructed Boolean AND search statement
