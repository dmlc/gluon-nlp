Use of fuzzy weighted autocorrelation function for pitch extraction from noisy
	speech
An investigation is presented into the feasibility of incorporating a fuzzy
	weighting scheme into the calculation of an autocorrelation function
	for pitch extraction. Simulation results reveal that the proposed
	method provides better robustness against background noise than the
	conventional approaches for extracting pitch period in a noisy
	environment
