Two quantum analogues of Fisher information from a large deviation viewpoint of
	quantum estimation
We discuss two quantum analogues of the Fisher information, the symmetric
	logarithmic derivative Fisher information and Kubo-Mori-Bogoljubov
	Fisher information from a large deviation viewpoint of quantum
	estimation and prove that the former gives the true bound and the
	latter gives the bound of consistent superefficient estimators. As
	another comparison, it is shown that the difference between them is
	characterized by the change of the order of limits
