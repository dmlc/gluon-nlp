Much ado about nothing: Win32.Perrun
JPEG files do not contain any executable code and it is impossible to infect
	such files. The author takes a look at the details surrounding the
	Win32.Perrun virus and make clear exactly what it does. The main virus
	feature is its ability to affect JPEG image files (compressed graphic
	images) and to spread via affected JPEG files. The virus affects, or
	modifies, or alters JPEG files but does not "infect" them
