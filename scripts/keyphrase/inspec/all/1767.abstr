Bivariate fractal interpolation functions on rectangular domains
Non-tensor product bivariate fractal interpolation functions defined on gridded
	rectangular domains are constructed. Linear spaces consisting of these
	functions are introduced. The relevant Lagrange interpolation problem
	is discussed. A negative result about the existence of affine fractal
	interpolation functions defined on such domains is obtained
