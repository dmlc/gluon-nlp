The effects of technology on midcareer librarians
This article investigates technology competency requirements in the library
	profession. Using the position advertisements in American Libraries in
	five-year increments over a twenty-year period (1970-1990), the article
	examines and evaluates the advertised qualifications of positions and
	attempts to see if midcareer librarians-especially those who have
	achieved their degree prior to the change in MLS curriculum that
	currently emphasizes technology-are "effective" librarians in the
	present and future job market
