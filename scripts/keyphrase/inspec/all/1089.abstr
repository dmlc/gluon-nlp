Accuracy and stability of splitting with Stabilizing Corrections
This paper contains a convergence analysis for the method of stabilizing
	corrections, which is an internally consistent splitting scheme for
	initial-boundary value problems. To obtain more accuracy and a better
	treatment of explicit terms several extensions are regarded and
	analyzed. The relevance of the theoretical results is tested for
	convection-diffusion-reaction equations
