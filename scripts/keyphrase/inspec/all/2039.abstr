An inverse problem for a model of a hierarchical structure
We consider the inverse problem for the identification of the coefficient in a
	parabolic equation. The model is applied to describe the functioning of
	a hierarchical structure; it is also relevant for heat-conduction
	theory. Unique solvability of the inverse problem is proved
