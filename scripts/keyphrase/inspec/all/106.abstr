Quantum Zeno subspaces
The quantum Zeno effect is recast in terms of an adiabatic theorem when the
	measurement is described as the dynamical coupling to another quantum
	system that plays the role of apparatus. A few significant examples are
	proposed and their practical relevance discussed. We also focus on
	decoherence-free subspaces
