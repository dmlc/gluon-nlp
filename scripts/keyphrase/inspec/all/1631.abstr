Recovering lost efficiency of exponentiation algorithms on smart cards
At the RSA cryptosystem implementation stage, a major security concern is
	resistance against so-called side-channel attacks. Solutions are known
	but they increase the overall complexity by a non-negligible factor
	(typically, a protected RSA exponentiation is 133% slower). For the
	first time, protected solutions are proposed that do not penalise the
	running time of an exponentiation
