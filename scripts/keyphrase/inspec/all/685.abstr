Robotically enhanced placement of left ventricular epicardial electrodes during
	implantation of a biventricular implantable cardioverter defibrillator
	system
Biventricular pacing has gained increasing acceptance in advanced heart failure
	patients. One major limitation of this therapy is positioning the left
	ventricular stimulation lead via the coronary sinus. This report
	demonstrates the feasibility of totally endoscopic direct placement of
	an epicardial stimulation lead on the left ventricle using the daVinci
	surgical system
