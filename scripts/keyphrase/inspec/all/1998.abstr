A friction compensator for pneumatic control valves
A procedure that compensates for static friction (stiction) in pneumatic
	control valves is presented. The compensation is obtained by adding
	pulses to the control signal. The characteristics of the pulses are
	determined from the control action. The compensator is implemented in
	industrial controllers and control systems, and the industrial
	experiences show that the procedure reduces the control error during
	stick-slip motion significantly compared to standard control without
	stiction compensation
