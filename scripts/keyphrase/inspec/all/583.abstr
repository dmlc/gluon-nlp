Neural networks in optimal filtration
The combined use and mutual influence of neural networks and optimal filtering
	is considered; the neural-network and filtering approaches are compared
	by solving two simple optimal-filtering problems: linear filtering and
	the filtering of a binary telegraph signal corresponding to
	observations in discrete white noise
