Lossy SPICE models produce realistic averaged simulations
In previous averaged models, the state-space averaging technique or switch
	waveforms analysis were usually applied over perfect elements,
	non-inclusive of the ohmic losses. However, if these elements play an
	active role in the DC transfer function, they affect the small-signal
	AC analysis by introducing various damping effects. A model is
	introduced in a boost voltage-mode application
