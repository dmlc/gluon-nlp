Regularization of linear regression problems
The study considers robust estimation of linear regression parameters by the
	regularization method, the pseudoinverse method, and the Bayesian
	method allowing for correlations and errors in the data. Regularizing
	algorithms are constructed and their relationship with pseudoinversion,
	the Bayesian approach, and BLUE is investigated
