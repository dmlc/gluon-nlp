Hysteretic threshold logic and quasi-delay insensitive asynchronous design
We introduce the class of hysteretic linear-threshold (HLT) logic functions as
	a novel extension of linear threshold logic, and prove their general
	applicability for constructing state-holding Boolean functions. We then
	demonstrate a fusion of HLT logic with the quasi-delay insensitive
	style of asynchronous circuit design, complete with logical design
	examples. Future research directions are also identified
