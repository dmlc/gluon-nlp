A look at MonacoProfiler 4
The newest profiling program from Monaco Software adds some valuable features:
	support for up to 8-color printing, profiling for digital cameras,
	fine-tuning of black generation and tweaking of profile transforms. We
	tested its ease of use and a few of the advanced functions. In all,
	it's pretty good
