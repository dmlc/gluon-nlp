Risk theory with a nonlinear dividend barrier
In the framework of classical risk theory we investigate a surplus process in
	the presence of a nonlinear dividend barrier and derive equations for
	two characteristics of such a process, the probability of survival and
	the expected sum of discounted dividend payments. Number-theoretic
	solution techniques are developed for approximating these quantities
	and numerical illustrations are given for exponential claim sizes and a
	parabolic dividend barrier
