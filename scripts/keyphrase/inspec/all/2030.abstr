Elimination of zero-order diffraction in digital holography
A simple method to suppress the zero-order diffraction in the reconstructed
	image of digital holography is presented. In this method, the Laplacian
	of a detected hologram is used instead of the hologram itself for
	numerical reconstruction by computing the discrete Fresnel integral.
	This method can significantly improve the image quality and give better
	resolution and higher accuracy of the reconstructed image. The main
	advantages of this method are its simplicity in experimental
	requirements and convenience in data processing
