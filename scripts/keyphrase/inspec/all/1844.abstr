A multi-agent system infrastructure for software component marketplace: an
	ontological perspective
In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system architecture and an
	implemented prototype for a software component marketplace. We
	emphasize the ontological perspective by discussing ontology modeling
	for the component marketplace, UML extensions for ontology modeling,
	and the idea of ontology transfer which makes the multi-agent system
	adapt itself to dynamically changing ontologies
