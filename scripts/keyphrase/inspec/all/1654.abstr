Numerical validation of solutions of complementarity problems: the nonlinear
	case
This paper proposes a validation method for solutions of nonlinear
	complementarity problems. The validation procedure performs a
	computational test. If the result of the test is positive, then it is
	guaranteed that a given multi-dimensional interval either includes a
	solution or excludes all solutions of the nonlinear complementarity
	problem
