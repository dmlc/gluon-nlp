On abelian branched coverings of the sphere
We obtain an enumeration formula for the number of weak equivalence classes of
	the branched (A * B)-covering of the sphere with m-branch points, when
	A and B are finite abelian groups with (|A|, |B|) = 1. From this, we
	can deduce an explicit formula for enumerating the weak equivalence
	classes of pseudofree spherical (Zp * Zq)-actions on a given surface,
	when p and q are distinct primes
