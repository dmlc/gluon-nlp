Activity and location recognition using wearable sensors
Using measured acceleration and angular velocity data gathered through
	inexpensive, wearable sensors, this dead-reckoning method can determine
	a user's location, detect transitions between preselected locations,
	and recognize and classify sitting, standing, and walking behaviors.
	Experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness
