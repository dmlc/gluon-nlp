Simple...But complex
FlexPro 5.0, from Weisang and Co., is one of those products which aim to serve
	an often ignored range of data users: those who, in FlexPro's words,
	are interested in documenting, analysing and archiving data in the
	simplest way possible. The online help system is clearly designed to
	promote the product in this market segment, with a very clear
	introduction from first principles and a hands-on tutorial, and the
	live project to which it was applied was selected with this in mind
