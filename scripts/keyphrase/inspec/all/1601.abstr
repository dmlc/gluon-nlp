Solving the multiple competitive facilities location problem
In this paper we propose five heuristic procedures for the solution of the
	multiple competitive facilities location problem. A franchise of
	several facilities is to be located in a trade area where competing
	facilities already exist. The objective is to maximize the market share
	captured by the franchise as a whole. We perform extensive
	computational tests and conclude that a two-step heuristic procedure
	combining simulated annealing and an ascent algorithm provides the best
	solutions
