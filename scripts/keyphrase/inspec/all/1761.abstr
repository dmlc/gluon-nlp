Superconvergence of discontinuous Galerkin method for nonstationary hyperbolic
	equation
For the first order nonstationary hyperbolic equation taking the piecewise
	linear discontinuous Galerkin solver, we prove that under the uniform
	rectangular partition, such a discontinuous solver, after
	postprocessing, can have two and half approximative order which is half
	order higher than the optimal estimate by P. Lesaint and P. Raviart
	(1974) under the rectangular partition
