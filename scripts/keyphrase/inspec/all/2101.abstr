All-optical XOR gate using semiconductor optical amplifiers without additional
	input beam
The novel design of an all-optical XOR gate by using cross-gain modulation of
	semiconductor optical amplifiers has been suggested and demonstrated
	successfully at 10 Gb/s. Boolean AB and AB of the two input signals A
	and B have been obtained and combined to achieve the all-optical XOR
	gate. No additional input beam such as a clock signal or continuous
	wave light is used in this new design, which is required in other
	all-optical XOR gates
