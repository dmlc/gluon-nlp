Using extended logic programming for alarm-correlation in cellular phone
	networks
Alarm correlation is a necessity in large mobile phone networks, where the
	alarm bursts resulting from severe failures would otherwise overload
	the network operators. We describe how to realize alarm-correlation in
	cellular phone networks using extended logic programming. To this end,
	we describe an algorithm and system solving the problem, a model of a
	mobile phone network application, and a detailed solution for a
	specific scenario
