Power electronics spark new simulation challenges
This article discusses some of the changes that have taken place in power
	systems and explores some of the inherent requirements for simulation
	technologies in order to keep up with this rapidly changing
	environment. The authors describe how energy utilities are realizing
	that, with the appropriate tools, they can train and sustain engineers
	who can maintain a great insight into system dynamics
