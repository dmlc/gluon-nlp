A note on vector cascade algorithm
The focus of this paper is on the relationship between accuracy of multivariate
	refinable vector and vector cascade algorithm. We show that, if the
	vector cascade algorithm (1.5) with isotropic dilation converges to a
	vector-valued function with regularity, then the initial function must
	satisfy the Strang-Fix conditions
