An object-oriented version of SIMLIB (a simple simulation package)
This paper introduces an object-oriented version of SIMLIB (an
	easy-to-understand discrete-event simulation package). The
	object-oriented version is preferable to the original procedural
	language versions of SIMLIB in that it is easier to understand and
	teach simulation from an object point of view. A single-server queue
	simulation is demonstrated using the object-oriented SIMLIB
