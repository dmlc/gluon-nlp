The maximum possible EVPI
In this paper we calculate the maximum expected value of perfect information
	(EVPI) for any probability distribution for the states of the world.
	This maximum EVPI is an upper bound for the EVPI with given
	probabilities and thus an upper bound for any partial information about
	the states of the world
