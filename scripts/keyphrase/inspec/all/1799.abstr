Steady-state mean-square error analysis of the cross-correlation and constant
	modulus algorithm in a MIMO convolutive system
The cross-correlation and constant modulus algorithm (CC-CMA) has been proven
	to be an effective approach in the problem of joint blind equalisation
	and source separation in a multi-input and multi-output system. In the
	paper, the steady-state mean-square error performance of CC-CMA in a
	noise-free environment is studied, and a new expression is derived
	based on the energy preservation approach of Mai and Sayed (2000).
	Simulation studies are undertaken to support the analysis
