Women in computing around the world
This paper describes the participation of women in computing in more than 30
	countries, by focussing on participation at undergraduate level. A
	brief discussion covers how societal and cultural factors may affect
	women's participation. Statistics from many different sources are
	presented for comparison. Generally, participation is low - most
	countries fall in the 10-40% range with a few below 10% and a few above
	40%
