On the diophantine equation x/sup 2/+q/sup 2k+1/=y/sup n/
In this paper it has been proved that if q is an odd prime, q not=7 (mod 8), n
	is an odd integer >or=5, n is not a multiple of 3 and (h, n)=1,
	where h is the class number of the filed Q( square root (-q)), then the
	diophantine equation x/sup 2/+q/sup 2k+1/=y/sup n/ has exactly two
	families of solutions (q, n, k, x, y)
