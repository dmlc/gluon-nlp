Meeting of minds
Technical specialists need to think about their role in IT projects and how
	they communicate with end-users and other participants to ensure they
	contribute fully as team members. It is especially important to
	communicate and document trade-offs that may have to be made, including
	the rationale behind them, so that if requirements change, the impact
	and decisions can be readily communicated to the stakeholders
