The set of stable polynomials of linear discrete systems: its geometry
The multidimensional stability domain of linear discrete systems is studied.
	Its configuration is determined from the parameters of its intersection
	with coordinate axes, coordinate planes, and certain auxiliary planes.
	Counterexamples for the discrete variant of the Kharitonov theorem are
	given
