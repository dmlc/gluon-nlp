Estimating populations for collective dose calculations
The collective dose provides an estimate of the effects of facility operations
	on the public based on an estimate of the population in the area.
	Geographic information system software, electronic population data
	resources, and a personal computer were used to develop estimates of
	population within 80 km radii of two sites
