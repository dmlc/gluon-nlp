Optimal linear control in stabilizer design
The most common method of improving stability of the power system is the
	synthesis of the turbine and generator control systems, because of the
	high effectiveness and relatively low cost of these elements. The
	synthesis and construction of the effective synchronous generator and
	turbine controller is a very difficult task. This paper describes the
	seven step mu -synthesis approach to PSS design enabling the
	synchronous generator to remain stable over a wide range of system
	operating conditions
