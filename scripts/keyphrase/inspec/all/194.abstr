Books on demand: just-in-time acquisitions
The Purdue University Libraries Interlibrary Loan unit proposed a pilot project
	to purchase patrons' loan requests from Amazon. com, lend them to the
	patrons, and then add the titles to the collection. Staff analyzed
	previous monograph loans, developed ordering criteria, implemented the
	proposal as a pilot project for six months, and evaluated the resulting
	patron comments, statistics, and staff perceptions. As a result of
	enthusiastic patron comments and a review of the project statistics,
	the program was extended
