Error-probability analysis of MIL-STD-1773 optical fiber data buses
We have analyzed the error probabilities of MIL-STD-1773 optical fiber data
	buses with three modulation schemes, namely, original Manchester II
	bi-phase coding, PTMBC, and EMBC-BSF. Using these derived expressions
	of error probabilities, we can also compare the receiver sensitivities
	of such optical fiber data buses
