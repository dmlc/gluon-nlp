An intelligent tutoring system for a power plant simulator
In this paper, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is proposed for a power
	plant simulator. With a well designed ITS, the need for an instructor
	is minimized and the operator may readily and efficiently take, in
	real-time, the control of simulator with appropriate messages he(she)
	gets from the tutoring system. Using SIMULINK and based on object
	oriented programming (OOP) and C programming language, a fossil-fuelled
	power plant simulator with an ITS is proposed. Promising results are
	demonstrated for a typical power plant
