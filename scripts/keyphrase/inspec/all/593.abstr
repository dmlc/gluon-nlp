Fuzzy systems with overlapping Gaussian concepts: Approximation properties in
	Sobolev norms
In this paper the approximating capabilities of fuzzy systems with overlapping
	Gaussian concepts are considered. The target function is assumed to be
	sampled either on a regular gird or according to a uniform probability
	density. By exploiting a connection with Radial Basis Functions
	approximators, a new method for the computation of the system
	coefficients is provided, showing that it guarantees uniform
	approximation of the derivatives of the target function
