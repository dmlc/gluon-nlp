Application of multiprocessor systems for computation of jets
The article describes the implementation of methods for numerical solution of
	gas-dynamic problems on a wide class of multiprocessor systems,
	conventionally characterized as "cluster" systems. A standard
	data-transfer interface - the so-called message passing interface - is
	used for parallelization of application algorithms among processors.
	Simulation of jets escaping into a low-pressure region is chosen as a
	computational example
