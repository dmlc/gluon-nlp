MPEG-4 video object-based rate allocation with variable temporal rates
In object-based coding, bit allocation is performed at the object level and
	temporal rates of different objects may vary. The proposed algorithm
	deals with these two issues when coding multiple video objects (MVOs).
	The proposed algorithm is able to successfully achieve the target bit
	rate, effectively code arbitrarily shaped MVOs with different temporal
	rates, and maintain a stable buffer level
