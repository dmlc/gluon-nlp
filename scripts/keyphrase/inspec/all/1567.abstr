Asymptotic expansions for the zeros of certain special functions
We derive asymptotic expansions for the zeros of the cosine-integral Ci(x) and
	the Struve function H/sub 0/(x), and extend the available formulae for
	the zeros of Kelvin functions. Numerical evidence is provided to
	illustrate the accuracy of the expansions
