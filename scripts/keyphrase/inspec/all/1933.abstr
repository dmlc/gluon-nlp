Accelerated simulation of the steady-state availability of non-Markovian
	systems
A general accelerated simulation method for evaluation of the steady-state
	availability of non-Markovian systems is proposed. It is applied to the
	investigation of a class of systems with repair. Numerical examples are
	given
