Dedekind zeta-functions and Dedekind sums
In this paper we use Dedekind zeta functions of two real quadratic number
	fields at -1 to denote Dedekind sums of high rank. Our formula is
	different from that of Siegel's (1969). As an application, we get a
	polynomial representation of zeta /sub K/(-1) = zeta /sub K/(-1) =
	1/45(26n/sup 3/ - 41n +or- 9), n identical to +or-2(mod 5), where K =
	Q( square root (5q)), prime q = 4n/sup 2/ + 1, and the class number of
	quadratic number field K/sub 2/ = Q( square root q) is 1
