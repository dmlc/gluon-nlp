Happily ever after: plateauing as a means for long-term career satisfaction
Little did I know when I attended Judith Bardwick's presentation on plateauing
	at the ALA annual convention in 1988 that it would turn out to be one
	of the most valuable sessions I would attend at any library conference,
	since it has enabled me to understand the phenomenon of plateauing and
	to use the strategies she suggested to rejuvenate my career and
	personal life continually. Key concepts and solutions from her book and
	from other literature on plateauing are summarized and examples given
	as to how I incorporated them into my life
