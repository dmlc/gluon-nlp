Two-layer model for the formation of states of the hidden Markov chains
Procedures for the formation of states of the hidden Markov models are
	described. Formant amplitudes and frequencies are used as state
	features. The training strategy is presented that allows one to
	calculate the parameters of conditional probabilities of the generation
	of a given formant set by a given hidden state with the help of the
	maximum likelihood method
