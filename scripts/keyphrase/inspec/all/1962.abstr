The Bagsik Oscillator without complex numbers
We argue that the analysis of the so-called Bagsik Oscillator, recently
	published by Piotrowski and Sladkowski (2001), is erroneous due to: (1)
	the incorrect banking data used and (2) the application of statistical
	mechanism apparatus to processes that are totally deterministic
