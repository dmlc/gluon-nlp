Recognizing groups G/sub 2/(3/sup n/) by their element orders
It is proved that a finite group that is isomorphic to a simple non-Abelian
	group G = G/sub 2/(3/sup n/) is, up to isomorphism, recognized by a set
	omega (G) of its element orders, that is, H approximately= G if omega
	(H) = omega (G) for some finite group H
