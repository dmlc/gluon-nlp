Sensitivity calibration of ultrasonic detectors based using ADD diagrams
The paper considers basic problems related to utilization of ADD diagrams in
	calibrating sensitivity of ultrasonic detectors. We suggest that a
	convenient tool for solving such problems can be the software package
	ADD Universal. Version 2.1 designed for plotting individual ADD
	diagrams for normal and slanted transducers. The software is compatible
	with the contemporary operational system Windows-95(98). Reference
	signals for calibration are generated in a sample with cylindrical
	holes
