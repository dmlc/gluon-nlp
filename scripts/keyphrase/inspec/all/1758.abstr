Hilbert modular threefolds of arithmetic genus one
D. Weisser (1981) proved that there are exactly four Galois cubic number fields
	with Hilbert modular threefolds of arithmetic genus one. In this paper,
	we extend Weisser's work to cover all cubic number fields. Our main
	result is that there are exactly 33 fields with Hilbert modular
	threefolds of arithmetic genus one. These fields are enumerated
	explicitly
