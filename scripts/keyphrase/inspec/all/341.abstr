How should team captains order golfers on the final day of the Ryder Cup
	matches?
I used game theory to examine how team captains should select their slates for
	the final day of the Ryder Cup matches. Under the assumption that
	golfers have different abilities and are not influenced by pressure or
	momentum, I found that drawing names from a hat will do no worse than
	any other strategy
