Statistical inference with partial prior information based on a Gauss-type
	inequality
Potter and Anderson (1983) have developed a Bayesian decision procedure
	requiring the specification of a class of prior distributions
	restricted to have a minimal probability content for a given subset of
	the parameter space. They do not, however, provide a method for the
	selection of that subset. We show how a generalization of Gauss'
	inequality can be used to determine the relevant parameter subset
