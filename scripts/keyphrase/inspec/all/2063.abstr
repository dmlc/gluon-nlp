On emotion and bounded rationality: reply to Hanoch
The author refers to the comment made by Hanoch (see ibid. vol.49 (2000)) on
	his model of bounded rationality and the role of the Yerkes-Dodson law
	and emotional arousal in it. The author points out that Hanoch's
	comment, however, conspicuously fails to challenge - much less
	contradict - the central hypothesis of his paper. In addition, several
	of Hanoch's criticisms are based on a wrong characterization of the
	positions
