Optimization-based design of fixed-order controllers for command following
For discrete-time scalar systems, we propose an approach for designing feedback
	controllers of fixed order to minimize an upper bound on the peak
	magnitude of the tracking error to a given command input. The work
	makes use of linear programming to design over a class of closed-loop
	systems proposed for the rejection of non-zero initial conditions and
	bounded disturbances. We incorporate performance robustness in the form
	of a guaranteed upper bound on the peak magnitude of the tracking error
	under plant coprime factor uncertainty
