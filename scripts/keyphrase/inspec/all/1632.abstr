One structure for fractional delay filter with small number of multipliers
A wide-bandwidth, high-resolution fractional delay filter (FDF) structure with
	a small number of multipliers per output sample and a short coefficient
	computing time is presented. The proposal is based on the use of a
	frequency FDF design method up to only half of the Nyquist frequency,
	in a multirate structure
