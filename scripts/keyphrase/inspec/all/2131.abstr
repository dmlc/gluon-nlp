Diagnosis of the technical state of heat systems
A step-by-step approach to the diagnosis of the technical state of heat systems
	is stated. The class of physical defects is supplemented by the
	behavioral defects of objects, which are related to the disturbance of
	the modes of their operation. The implementation of the approach is
	illustrated by an example of the solution of a specific problem of the
	diagnosis of a closed heat consumption system
