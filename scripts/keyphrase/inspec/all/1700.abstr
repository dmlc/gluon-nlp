Computation of unmeasured third-generation VCT views from measured views
We compute unmeasured cone-beam projections from projections measured by a
	third-generation helical volumetric computed tomography system by
	solving a characteristic problem for an ultrahyperbolic differential
	equation [John (1938)]. By working in the Fourier domain, we convert
	the second-order PDE into a family of first-order ordinary differential
	equations. A simple first-order integration is used to solve the ODES
