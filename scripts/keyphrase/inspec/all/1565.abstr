On lag windows connected with Jacobi polynomials
Lag windows whose corresponding spectral windows are Jacobi polynomials or sums
	of Jacobi polynomials are introduced. The bias and variance of their
	spectral density estimators are investigated and their window bandwidth
	and characteristic exponent are determined
