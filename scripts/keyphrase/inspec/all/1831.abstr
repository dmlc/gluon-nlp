Fast broadcasting and gossiping in radio networks
We establish an O(n log/sup 2/ n) upper bound on the time for deterministic
	distributed broadcasting in multi-hop radio networks with unknown
	topology. This nearly matches the known lower bound of Omega (n log n).
	The fastest previously known algorithm for this problem works in time
	O(n/sup 3/2/). Using our broadcasting algorithm, we develop an O(n/sup
	3/2/ log/sup 2/ n) algorithm for gossiping in the same network model
