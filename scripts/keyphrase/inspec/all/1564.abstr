Asymptotic normality for the K/sub phi /-divergence goodness-of-fit tests
In this paper for a wide class of goodness-of-fit statistics based K/sub phi
	/-divergences, the asymptotic normality is established under the
	assumption n/m/sub n/ to a in (0, infinity ), where n denotes sample
	size and m/sub n/ the number of cells. This result is extended to
	contiguous alternatives to study asymptotic efficiency
