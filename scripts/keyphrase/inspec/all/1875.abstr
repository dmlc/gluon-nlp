The design and implementation of VAMPIRE
We describe VAMPIRE: a high-performance theorem prover for first-order logic.
	As our description is mostly targeted to the developers of such systems
	and specialists in automated reasoning, it focuses on the design of the
	system and some key implementation features. We also analyze the
	performance of the prover at CASC-JC
