Evolution of litigation support systems
For original paper see ibid., vol. 12, no. 6: "The E-mail of the Species". The
	author responds to that paper and argues that printing, scanning and
	imaging E-mails or other electronic (rather than paper) documents prior
	to listing and disclosure seems to be unnecessary, not 'proportionate'
	(from a costs point of view) and not particularly helpful, to either
	side. He asks how litigation support systems might evolve to help and
	support the legal team in their task
