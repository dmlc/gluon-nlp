Regularity of some 'incomplete' Pal-type interpolation problems
In this paper the regularity of nine Pal-type interpolation problems is proved.
	In the literature interpolation on the zeros of the pair W/sub n//sup (
	alpha )/(z) = (z + alpha )/sup n/ + (1 + alpha z)/sup n/, v/sub n//sup
	( alpha )/(z) = (z + alpha )/sup n/ - (1 + alpha z)/sup n/ with 0 <
	alpha < 1 has been studied. Here the nodes form a subset of these
	sets of zeros
