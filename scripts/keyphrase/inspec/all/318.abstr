Note on "Deterministic inventory lot-size models under inflation with shortages
	and deterioration for fluctuating demand" by Yang et al
For original paper see H.-L. Yang et al., ibid., vol.48, p.144-58 (2001). Yang
	et al. extended the lot-size models to allow for inflation and
	fluctuating demand. For this model they proved that the optimal
	replenishment schedule exists and is unique. They also proposed an
	algorithm to find the optimal policy. The present paper provides
	examples, which show that the optimal replenishment schedule and
	consequently the overall optimal policy may not exist
