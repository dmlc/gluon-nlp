Parallel interior point schemes for solving multistage convex programming
The predictor-corrector interior-point path-following algorithm is promising in
	solving multistage convex programming problems. Among many other
	general good features of this algorithm, especially attractive is that
	the algorithm allows the possibility to parallelise the major
	computations. The dynamic structure of the multistage problems
	specifies a block-tridiagonal system at each Newton step of the
	algorithm. A wrap-around permutation is then used to implement the
	parallel computation for this step
