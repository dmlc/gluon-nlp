Single-phase shunt active power filter with harmonic detection
An advanced active power filter for the compensation of instantaneous harmonic
	current components in nonlinear current loads is presented. A signal
	processing technique using an adaptive neural network algorithm is
	applied for the detection of harmonic components generated by nonlinear
	current loads and it can efficiently determine the instantaneous
	harmonic components in real time. The validity of this active filtering
	processing system to compensate current harmonics is substantiated by
	simulation results
