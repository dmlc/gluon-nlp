Quantum limit on computational time and speed
We investigate if physical laws can impose limits on computational time and
	speed of a quantum computer built from elementary particles. We show
	that the product of the speed and the running time of a quantum
	computer is limited by the type of fundamental interactions present
	inside the system. This will help us to decide as to what type of
	interaction should be allowed in building quantum computers in
	achieving the desired speed
