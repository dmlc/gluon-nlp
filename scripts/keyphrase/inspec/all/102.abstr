Harmless delays in Cohen-Grossberg neural networks
Without assuming monotonicity and differentiability of the activation functions
	and any symmetry of interconnections, we establish some sufficient
	conditions for the globally asymptotic stability of a unique
	equilibrium for the Cohen-Grossberg (1983) neural network with multiple
	delays. Lyapunov functionals and functions combined with the Razumikhin
	technique are employed. The criteria are all independent of the
	magnitudes of the delays, and thus the delays under these conditions
	are harmless
