48 Gbit/s InP DHBT MS-DFF with very low time jitter
A master-slave D-type flip-flop (MS DFF) fabricated in a self-aligned InP DHBT
	technology is presented. The packaged circuit shows full-rate clock
	operation at 48 Gbit/s. Very low time jitter and good retiming
	capabilities are observed. Layout aspects, packaging and measurement
	issues are discussed in particular
