Resolution of a current-mode algorithmic analog-to-digital converter
Errors limiting the resolution of current-mode algorithmic analog-to-digital
	converters are mainly related to current mirror operation. While
	systematic errors can be minimized by proper circuit techniques, random
	sources are unavoidable. In this paper a statistical analysis of the
	resolution of a typical converter is carried out taking into account
	process tolerances. To support the analysis, a 4-bit ADC, realized in a
	0.35- mu m CMOS technology, was exhaustively simulated. Results were
	found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical derivations
