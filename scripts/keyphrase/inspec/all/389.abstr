Bayesian nonstationary autoregressive models for biomedical signal analysis
We describe a variational Bayesian algorithm for the estimation of a
	multivariate autoregressive model with time-varying coefficients that
	adapt according to a linear dynamical system. The algorithm allows for
	time and frequency domain characterization of nonstationary
	multivariate signals and is especially suited to the analysis of
	event-related data. Results are presented on synthetic data and real
	electroencephalogram data recorded in event-related desynchronization
	and photic synchronization scenarios
