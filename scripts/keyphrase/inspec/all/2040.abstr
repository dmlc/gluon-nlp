Inverse problems for a mathematical model of ion exchange in a compressible ion
	exchanger
A mathematical model of ion exchange is considered, allowing for ion exchanger
	compression in the process of ion exchange. Two inverse problems are
	investigated for this model, unique solvability is proved, and
	numerical solution methods are proposed. The efficiency of the proposed
	methods is demonstrated by a numerical experiment
