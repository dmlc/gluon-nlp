A numerical C/sup 1/-shadowing result for retarded functional differential
	equations
This paper gives a numerical C/sup 1/-shadowing between the exact solutions of
	a functional differential equation and its numerical approximations.
	The shadowing result is obtained by comparing exact solutions with
	numerical approximation which do not share the same initial value.
	Behavior of stable manifolds of functional differential equations under
	numerics will follow from the shadowing result
