Personal cards for on-line purchases
Buying presents over the Web has advantages for a busy person: lots of choices,
	24-hour accessibility, quick delivery, and you don't even have to wrap
	the gift. But many people like to select a card or write a personal
	note to go with their presents, and the options for doing that have
	been limited. Two companies have seen this limitation as an
	opportunity: 4YourSoul.com and CardintheBox.com
