Yet some more complexity results for default logic
We identify several new tractable subsets and several new intractable simple
	cases for reasoning in the propositional version of Reiter's default
	logic. The majority of our findings are related to brave reasoning. By
	making some intuitive observations, most classes that we identify can
	be derived quite easily from some subsets of default logic already
	known in the literature. Some of the subsets we discuss are subclasses
	of the so-called "extended logic programs". All the tractable subsets
	presented in this paper can be recognized in linear time
