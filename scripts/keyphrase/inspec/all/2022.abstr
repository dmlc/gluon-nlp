Two-step integral imaging for orthoscopic three-dimensional imaging with
	improved viewing resolution
We present a two-step integral imaging system to obtain 3-D orthoscopic real
	images. By adopting a nonstationary micro-optics technique, we
	demonstrate experimentally the potential usefulness of two-step
	integral imaging
