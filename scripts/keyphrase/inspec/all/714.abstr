Embeddings of planar graphs that minimize the number of long-face cycles
We consider the problem of finding embeddings of planar graphs that minimize
	the number of long-face cycles. We prove that for any k >or= 4, it
	is NP-complete to find an embedding that minimizes the number of face
	cycles of length at least k
