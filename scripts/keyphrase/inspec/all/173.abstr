Stock market trading rule discovery using technical charting heuristics
In this case study in knowledge engineering and data mining, we implement a
	recognizer for two variations of the 'bull flag' technical charting
	heuristic and use this recognizer to discover trading rules on the NYSE
	Composite Index. Out-of-sample results indicate that these rules are
	effective
