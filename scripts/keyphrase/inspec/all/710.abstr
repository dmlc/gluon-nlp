Optimal allocation of runs in a simulation metamodel with several independent
	variables
Cheng and Kleijnen (1999) propose a very general regression metamodel for
	modelling the output of a queuing system. Its main limitations are that
	the regression function is based on a polynomial and that it can use
	only one independent variable. These limitations are removed here. We
	derive an explicit formula for the optimal way of assigning simulation
	runs to the different design points
