Industrial/sup IT/ for performance buildings
ABB has taken a close look at how buildings are used and has come up with a
	radical solution for the technical infrastructure that places the
	end-user's processes at the center and integrates all the building's
	systems around their needs. The new solution is based on the
	realization that tasks like setting up an office meeting, registering a
	hotel guest or moving a patient in a hospital, can all benefit from the
	same Industrial IT concepts employed by ABB to optimize manufacturing,
	for example in the automotive industry
