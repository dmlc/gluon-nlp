Estimation of the Poisson stream intensity in a multilinear queue with an
	exponential job queue decay
Times the busy queue periods start are found for a multilinear queue with an
	exponential job queue decay and uniform resource allocation to
	individual servers. The stream intensity and the average job are
	estimated from observations of the times the queue busy periods start
