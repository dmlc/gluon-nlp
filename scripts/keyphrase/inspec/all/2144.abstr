The perils of privacy
The recent string of failures among dotcom companies has heightened fears of
	privacy abuse. What should happen to the names and addresses on a
	customer list if these details were obtained under a privacy policy
	which specified no disclosure to any third party? Should the personal
	data in the list be deemed to be an asset of a failing company which
	can be transferred to any future (third party) purchaser for its
	purposes? Or should the privacy policy take precedence over the
	commercial concerns of the purchaser?
