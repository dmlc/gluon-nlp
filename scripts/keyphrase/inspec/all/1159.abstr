Sigma -admissible families over linear orders
Admissible sets of the form HYP(M), where M is a recursively saturated system,
	are treated. We provide descriptions of subsets M, which are Sigma /sub
	*/-sets in HYP(M), and of families of subsets M, which form Sigma
	-regular families in HYP(M), in terms of the concept of being
	fundamental couched in the article. Fundamental subsets and families
	are characterized for models of dense linear orderings
