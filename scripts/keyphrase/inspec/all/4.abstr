Industry insiders loading up on cheap company stock
A surge of telecom executives and directors purchasing their own companies,
	stock in the last two months points toward a renewed optimism in the
	beleaguered sector, say some observers, who view the rash of insider
	buying as a vote of confidence from management. Airgate PCS, Charter
	Communications, Cox Communications, Crown Castle International, Nextel
	Communications and Nortel Networks all have seen infusions of insider
	investment this summer, echoing trends in both the telecom industry and
	the national economy
