A VMEbus interface for multi-detector trigger and control system
MUSE (MUltiplicity SElector) is the trigger and control system of CHIMERA, a 4
	pi charged particle detector. Initialization of MUSE can be performed
	via VMEbus. This paper describes the design of VMEbus interface and
	functional module in MUSE, and briefly discusses an application of MUSE
