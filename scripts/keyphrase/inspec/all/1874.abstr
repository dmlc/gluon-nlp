E - a brainiac theorem prover
We describe the superposition-based theorem prover E. E is a sound and complete
	prover for clausal first order logic with equality. Important
	properties of the prover include strong redundancy elimination
	criteria, the DISCOUNT loop proof procedure, a very flexible interface
	for specifying search control heuristics, and an efficient inference
	engine. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the system
