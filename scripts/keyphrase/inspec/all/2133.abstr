Nonlockability in multirings and hypercubes at serial transmission of data
	blocks
For the multiring and hypercube, a method of conflictless realization of an
	arbitrary permutation of "large" data items that can be divided into
	many "smaller" data blocks was considered, and its high efficiency was
	demonstrated
