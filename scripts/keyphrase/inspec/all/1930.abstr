A new method of systemological analysis coordinated with the procedure of
	object-oriented design. II
For pt.I. see Vestn. KhGPU, no.81, p.15-18 (2000). The paper presents the
	results of development of an object-oriented systemological method used
	to design complex systems. A formal system representation, as well as
	an axiomatics of the calculus of systems as functional flow-type
	objects based on a Node-Function-Object class hierarchy are proposed. A
	formalized NFO/UFO analysis algorithm and CASE tools used to support it
	are considered
