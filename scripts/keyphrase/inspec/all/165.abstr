Monitoring the news online
The author looks at how we can focus on what we want, finding small stories in
	vast oceans of news. There is no one tool that will scan every news
	resource available and give alerts on new available materials. Every
	one has a slightly different focus. Some are paid sources, while many
	are free. If used wisely, an excellent news monitoring system for a
	large number of topics can be set up for surprisingly little cost
