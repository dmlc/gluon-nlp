Adaptive array antenna based on radial basis function network as multiuser
	detection for WCDMA
An adaptive array antenna is proposed based on the radial basis function (RBF)
	network as a multiuser detector for a WCDMA system. The proposed system
	calculates the optimal combining weight coefficients using sample
	matrix inversion with a common correlation matrix algorithm and obtains
	the channel response vector using the RBF output signal
