Information-processing and computing systems at thermal power stations in China
The development and commissioning of information-processing and computing
	systems (IPCSs) at four power units, each of 500 MW capacity at the
	thermal power stations Tszisyan' and Imin' in China, are considered.
	The functional structure and the characteristics of the functions of
	the IPCSs are presented as is information on the technology of
	development and experience in adjustments. Ways of using the experience
	gained in creating a comprehensive functional firmware system are shown
