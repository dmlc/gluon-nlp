People who make a difference: mentors and role models
The literature of gender issues in computing steadfastly and uniformly has
	advocated the use of mentors and role models (M&RM) for recruiting and
	retaining women in computer science. This paper, therefore, accepts the
	results of research studies and avoids reiterating details of the
	projects but offers instead a practical guide for using M&RM to recruit
	and retain women in computer science. The guide provides pragmatic
	advice, describing several different facets of the M&RM concept
