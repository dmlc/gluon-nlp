CAD/CAE software aids converter design [DC/DC power conversion]
Typically, power supply design involves electronic and magnetic components. In
	this paper, the authors describe, using a flyback converter example,
	how CAD/CAE tools can aid the power supply engineer in both areas,
	reducing prototyping costs and providing insights into system
	performance
