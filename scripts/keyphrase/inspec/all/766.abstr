Physical quantum algorithms
I review the differences between classical and quantum systems, emphasizing the
	connection between no-hidden variable theorems and superior
	computational power of quantum computers. Using quantum lattice gas
	automata as examples, I describe possibilities for efficient simulation
	of quantum and classical systems with a quantum computer. I conclude
	with a list of research directions
