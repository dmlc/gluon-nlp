Algorithmic results for ordered median problems
In a series of papers a new type of objective function in location theory,
	called ordered median function, has been introduced and analyzed. This
	objective function unifies and generalizes most common objective
	functions used in location theory. In this paper we identify finite
	dominating sets for these models and develop polynomial time algorithms
	together with a detailed complexity analysis
