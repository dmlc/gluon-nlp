Solution of the reconstruction problem of a source function in the
	coagulation-fragmentation equation
We study the problem of reconstructing a source function in the kinetic
	coagulation-fragmentation equation. The study is based on optimal
	control methods, the solvability theory of operator equations, and the
	use of iteration algorithms
