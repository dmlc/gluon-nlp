Establishing the discipline of physics-based CMP modeling
For the past decade, a physically based comprehensive process model for
	chemical mechanical polishing has eluded the semiconductor industry.
	However, a long-term collaborative effort has now resulted in a
	workable version of that approach. The highly fundamental model is
	based on advanced finite element analysis and is beginning to show
	promise in CMP process development
