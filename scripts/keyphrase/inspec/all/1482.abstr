A parareal in time procedure for the control of partial differential equations
We have proposed in a previous note a time discretization for partial
	differential evolution equation that allows for parallel
	implementations. This scheme is here reinterpreted as a preconditioning
	procedure on an algebraic setting of the time discretization. This
	allows for extending the parallel methodology to the problem of optimal
	control for partial differential equations. We report a first numerical
	implementation that reveals a large interest
