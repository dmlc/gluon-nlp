Ant colony optimization and stochastic gradient descent
We study the relationship between the two techniques known as ant colony
	optimization (ACO) and stochastic gradient descent. More precisely, we
	show that some empirical ACO algorithms approximate stochastic gradient
	descent in the space of pheromones, and we propose an implementation of
	stochastic gradient descent that belongs to the family of ACO
	algorithms. We then use this insight to explore the mutual
	contributions of the two techniques
