Deriving model parameters from field test measurements [generator control
	simulation]
A major component of any power system simulation is the generating plant. The
	purpose of DeriveAssist is to speed up the parameter derivation process
	and to allow engineers less versed in parameter matching and
	identification to get involved in the process of power plant electric
	generator modelling
