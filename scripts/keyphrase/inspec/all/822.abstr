Reinventing broadband
Many believe that broadband providers need to change their whole approach. The
	future, then, is in reinventing broadband. That means tiered pricing to
	make broadband more competitive with dial-up access and livelier, more
	distinct content: video on demand, MP3, and other features exclusive to
	the fat-pipe superhighway
