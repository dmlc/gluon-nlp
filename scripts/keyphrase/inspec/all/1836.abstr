Parcel boundary identification with computer-assisted boundary overlay process
	for Taiwan
The study investigates the design of a process for parcel boundary
	identification with cadastral map overlay using the principle of least
	squares. The objective of this research is to provide an objective tool
	for boundary identification survey. The proposed process includes an
	adjustment model, a weighting scheme, and other related operations. A
	numerical example is included
