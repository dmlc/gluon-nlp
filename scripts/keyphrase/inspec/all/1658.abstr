Chaos theory as a framework for studying information systems
This paper introduces chaos theory as a means of studying information systems.
	It argues that chaos theory, combined with new techniques for
	discovering patterns in complex quantitative and qualitative evidence,
	offers a potentially more substantive approach to understand the nature
	of information systems in a variety of contexts. The paper introduces
	chaos theory concepts by way of an illustrative research design
