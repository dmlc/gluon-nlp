Quantum universal variable-length source coding
We construct an optimal quantum universal variable-length code that achieves
	the admissible minimum rate, i.e., our code is used for any probability
	distribution of quantum states. Its probability of exceeding the
	admissible minimum rate exponentially goes to 0. Our code is optimal in
	the sense of its exponent. In addition, its average error
	asymptotically tends to 0
