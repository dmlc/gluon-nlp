A method for solution of systems of linear algebraic equations with
	m-dimensional lambda -matrices
A system of linear algebraic equations with m-dimensional lambda -matrices is
	considered. The proposed method of searching for the solution of this
	system lies in reducing it to a numerical system of a special kind
