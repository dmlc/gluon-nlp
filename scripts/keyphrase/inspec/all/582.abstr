Optimal estimation of a finite sample of a discrete chaotic process
The synthesis of optimal algorithms for estimating discrete chaotic processes
	specified by a finite sample is considered; various possible approaches
	are discussed. Expressions determining the potential accuracy in
	estimating a single value of the chaotic process are derived. An
	example of the application of the general equations obtained is given
