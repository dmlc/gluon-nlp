Plug-ins for critical media literacy: a collaborative program
Information literacy is important in academic and other libraries. The paper
	looks at whether it would be more useful to librarians and to
	instructors, as well as the students, to deal with information-literacy
	skill levels of students beginning their academic careers, rather than
	checking them at the end. Approaching the situation with an eye toward
	the broader scope of critical media literacy opens the discussion
	beyond a skills inventory to the broader range of intellectual activity
