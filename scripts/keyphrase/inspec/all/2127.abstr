System embedding. Polynomial equations
The class of solutions of the polynomial equations including their
	generalizations in the form of the Bezout matrix identities was
	constructed analytically using the technology of constructive system
	embedding. The structure of a solution depends on the number of steps
	of the Euclidean algorithm and is obtained explicitly by appropriate
	substitutions. Illustrative and descriptive examples are presented
