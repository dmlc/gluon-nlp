Learning spatial relations using an inductive logic programming system
The ability to learn spatial relations is a prerequisite for performing many
	relevant tasks such as those associated with motion, orientation,
	navigation, etc. This paper reports on using an Inductive Logic
	Programming (ILP) system for learning function-free Horn-clause
	descriptions of spatial knowledge. Its main contribution, however, is
	to show that an existing relation between two reference systems-the
	speaker-relative and the absolute-can be automatically learned by an
	ILP system, given the proper background knowledge and positive examples
