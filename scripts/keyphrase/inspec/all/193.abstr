Twenty years of the literature on acquiring out-of-print materials
This article reviews the last two-and-a-half decades of literature on acquiring
	out-of-print materials to assess recurring issues and identify changing
	practices. The out-of-print literature is uniform in its assertion that
	libraries need to acquire o.p. materials to replace worn or damaged
	copies, to replace missing copies, to duplicate copies of heavily used
	materials, to fill gaps in collections, to strengthen weak collections,
	to continue to develop strong collections, and to provide materials for
	new courses, new programs, and even entire new libraries
