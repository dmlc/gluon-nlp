The quadratic 0-1 knapsack problem with series-parallel support
We consider various special cases of the quadratic 0-1 knapsack problem (QKP)
	for which the underlying graph structure is fairly simple. For the
	variant with edge series-parallel graphs, we give a dynamic programming
	algorithm with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, and a fully
	polynomial time approximation scheme. In strong contrast to this, the
	variant with vertex series-parallel graphs is shown to be strongly
	NP-complete
