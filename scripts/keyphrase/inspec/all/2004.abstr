New paradigms for interactive 3D volume segmentation
We present a new virtual reality-based interaction metaphor for semi-automatic
	segmentation of medical 3D volume data. The mouse-based, manual
	initialization of deformable surfaces in 3D represents a major
	bottleneck in interactive segmentation. In our multi-modal system we
	enhance this process with additional sensory feedback. A 3D haptic
	device is used to extract the centreline of a tubular structure. Based
	on the obtained path a cylinder with varying diameter is generated,
	which in turn is used as the initial guess for a deformable surface
