The design and performance evaluation of alternative XML storage strategies
This paper studies five strategies for storing XML documents including one that
	leaves documents in the file system, three that use a relational
	database system, and one that uses an object manager. We implement and
	evaluate each approach using a number of XQuery queries. A number of
	interesting insights are gained from these experiments and a summary of
	the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches is presented
