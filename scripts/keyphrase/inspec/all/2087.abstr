Re-examining the machining frictional boundary conditions using fractals
Presents experimental evidence for the existence of non-Euclidean contact
	geometry at the tool-chip interface in the machining of aluminium
	alloy, which challenges conventional assumptions. The geometry of
	contact at the tool rake face is modelled using fractals and a
	dimension is computed for its description. The variation in the fractal
	dimension with the cutting speed is explored
