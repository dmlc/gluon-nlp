Nissan v. Nissan [trademark dispute]
Is a trademark dispute a case of David v. Goliath or a corporation fending off
	a greedy opportunist? This paper discusses the case of Uzi Nissan, who
	is locked in a multimillion-dollar legal battle over whether or not his
	use of the nissan.com Internet domain name infringes upon Japan's
	Nissan Motor Co.'s trademark. At the heart of the matter is the impact
	of the global Internet on trademark law, which traditionally has been
	strongly influenced by geographic considerations. The paper discusses
	the background to the case from both sides and the issues involved
