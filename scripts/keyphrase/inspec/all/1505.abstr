Modeling and simulating practices, a work method for work systems design
Work systems involve people engaging in activities over time-not just with each
	other, but also with machines, tools, documents, and other artifacts.
	These activities often produce goods, services, or-as is the case in
	the work system described in this article-scientific data. Work systems
	and work practice evolve slowly over time. The integration and use of
	technology, the distribution and collocation of people, organizational
	roles and procedures, and the facilities where the work occurs largely
	determine this evolution
