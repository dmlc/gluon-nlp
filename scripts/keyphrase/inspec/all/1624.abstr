Genetic algorithm for input/output selection in MIMO systems based on
	controllability and observability indices
A time domain optimisation algorithm using a genetic algorithm in conjunction
	with a linear search scheme has been developed to find the smallest or
	near-smallest subset of inputs and outputs to control a
	multi-input-multi-output system. Experimental results have shown that
	this proposed algorithm has a very fast convergence rate and high
	computation efficiency
