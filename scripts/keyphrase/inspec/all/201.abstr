Correction to construction of panoramic image mosaics with global and local
	alignment
For original paper see ibid., vol. 36, no. 2, p. 101-30 (2000). The authors had
	given a method for the construction of panoramic image mosaics with
	global and local alignment. Unfortunately a mistake had led to an
	incorrect equation which whilst making little difference in many cases,
	for faster (and assured) convergence, the correct formulae given here
	should be used
