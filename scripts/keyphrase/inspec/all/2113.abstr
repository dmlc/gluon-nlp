Ideal sliding mode in the problems of convex optimization
The characteristics of the sliding mode that appears with using continuous
	convex-programming algorithms based on the exact penalty functions were
	discussed. For the case under study, the ideal sliding mode was shown
	to occur in the absence of infinite number of switchings
