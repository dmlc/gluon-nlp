Moving into the mainstream [product lifecycle management]
Product lifecycle management (PLM) is widely recognised by most manufacturing
	companies, as manufacturers begin to identify and implement targeted
	projects intended to deliver return-on investment in a timely fashion.
	Vendors are also releasing second-generation PLM products that are
	packaged, out-of-the-box solutions
