Reconfigurable context-sensitive middleware for pervasive computing
Context-sensitive applications need data from sensors, devices, and user
	actions, and might need ad hoc communication support to dynamically
	discover new devices and engage in spontaneous information exchange.
	Reconfigurable Context-Sensitive Middleware facilitates the development
	and runtime operations of context-sensitive pervasive computing
	software
