Laguerre approximation of fractional systems
Systems characterised by fractional power poles can be called fractional
	systems. Here, Laguerre orthogonal polynomials are employed to
	approximate fractional systems by minimum phase, reduced order,
	rational transfer functions. Both the time and the frequency-domain
	analysis exhibit the accuracy of the approximation
