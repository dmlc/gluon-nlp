Affine invariants of convex polygons
In this correspondence, we prove that the affine invariants, for image
	registration and object recognition, proposed recently by Yang and
	Cohen (see ibid., vol.8, no.7, p.934-46, July 1999) are algebraically
	dependent. We show how to select an independent and complete set of the
	invariants. The use of this new set leads to a significant reduction of
	the computing complexity without decreasing the discrimination power
