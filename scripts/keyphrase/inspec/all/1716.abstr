The vibration reliability of poppet and contoured actuator valves
The problem of selecting the shape of the actuator valve (the final control
	valve) itself is discussed; the solution to this problem will permit
	appreciable dynamic loads to be eliminated from the moving elements of
	the steam distribution system of steam turbines under all operating
	conditions
