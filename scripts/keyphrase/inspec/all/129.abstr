Phase conditions for Schur polynomials
The rate of change of phase of a real or complex Schur polynomial, evaluated
	along the unit circle traversed counterclockwise, is strictly positive.
	For polynomials with real coefficients, this bound can be tightened.
	These and some other fundamental bounds on the rate of change of phase
	are derived here, using the Tchebyshev representation of the image of a
	real polynomial evaluated on the unit circle
