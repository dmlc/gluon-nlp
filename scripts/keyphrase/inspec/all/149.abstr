Extending Kamp's theorem to model time granularity
In this paper, a generalization of Kamp's theorem relative to the functional
	completeness of the until operator is proved. Such a generalization
	consists in showing the functional completeness of more expressive
	temporal operators with respect to the extension of the first-order
	theory of linear orders MFO[<] with an extra binary relational
	symbol. The result is motivated by the search of a modal language
	capable of expressing properties and operators suitable to model time
	granularity in omega -layered temporal structures
