Discreteness and relevance: a reply to Roman Poznanski
In reply to Poznanski (see ibid., p.435, 2002) on discreteness and relevance,
	Eliasmith claims that all of the concerns voiced by Poznanski in his
	reply fail to offer a serious challenge to the idea that continuity is
	irrelevant to a good understanding of cognitive systems. Eliasmith
	hopes that it is evident that he does not claim that the process in
	neural systems is discrete, but rather that a complete characterization
	of the process can be discrete; these of course are significantly
	different claims
