Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger paradoxes for many qubits
We construct Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) contradictions for three or more
	parties sharing an entangled state, the dimension of each subsystem
	being an even integer d. The simplest example that goes beyond the
	standard GHZ paradox (three qubits) involves five ququats (d = 4). We
	then examine the criteria that a GHZ paradox must satisfy in order to
	be genuinely M partite and d dimensional
