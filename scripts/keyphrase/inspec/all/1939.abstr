Compatibility of systems of linear constraints over the set of natural numbers
Criteria of compatibility of a system of linear Diophantine equations, strict
	inequations, and nonstrict inequations are considered. Upper bounds for
	components of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction
	of minimal generating sets of solutions for all types of systems are
	given. These criteria and the corresponding algorithms for constructing
	a minimal supporting set of solutions can be used in solving all the
	considered types of systems and systems of mixed types
