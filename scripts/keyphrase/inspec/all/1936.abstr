A new approach to the decomposition of Boolean functions by the method of
	q-partitions.II. Repeated decomposition
For pt.I. see Upr. Sist. Mash., no. 6, p. 29-42 (1999). A new approach to the
	decomposition of Boolean,functions that depend on n variables and are
	represented in various forms is considered. The approach is based on
	the method of q-partitioning of minterms and on the introduced concept
	of a decomposition clone. The theorem on simple disjunctive
	decomposition of full and partial functions is formulated. The approach
	proposed is illustrated by examples
