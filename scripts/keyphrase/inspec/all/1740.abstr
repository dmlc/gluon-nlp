Verification of ideological classifications-a statistical approach
The paper presents a statistical method of verifying ideological
	classifications of votes. Parliamentary votes, preclassified by an
	expert (on a chosen subset), are verified at an assumed significance
	level by seeking the most likely match with the actual vote results.
	Classifications that do not meet the requirements defined are rejected.
	The results obtained can be applied in the ideological dimensioning
	algorithms, enabling ideological identification of dimensions obtained
