New water management system begins operation at US projects
The US Army Corps of Engineers has developed a new automated information system
	to support its water control management mission. The new system
	provides a variety of decision support tools, enabling water control
	managers to acquire, transform, verify, store, display, analyse, and
	disseminate data and information efficiently and around the clock
