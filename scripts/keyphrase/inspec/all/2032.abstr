Adaptive digital watermarking using fuzzy logic techniques
Digital watermarking has been proposed for copyright protection in our digital
	society. We propose an adaptive digital watermarking scheme based on
	the human visual system model and a fuzzy logic technique. The fuzzy
	logic approach is employed to obtain the different strengths and
	lengths of a watermark by the local characteristics of the image in our
	proposed scheme. In our experiments, this scheme provides a more robust
	and imperceptible watermark
