Strong completeness of lattice-valued logic
This paper shows strong completeness of the system L for lattice valued logic
	given by S. Titani (1999), in which she formulates a lattice-valued set
	theory by introducing the logical implication which represents the
	order relation on the lattice. Syntax and semantics concerned are
	described and strong completeness is proved
