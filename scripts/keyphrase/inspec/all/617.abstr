Estimation of trifocal tensor using GMM
A novel estimation of a trifocal tensor based on the Gaussian mixture model
	(GMM) is presented. The mixture model is built assuming that the
	residuals of inliers and outliers belong to different Gaussian
	distributions. The Bayesian rule is then employed to detect the inliers
	for re-estimation. Experiments show that the presented method is more
	precise and relatively unaffected by outliers
