Novel denoising algorithm for obtaining a superresolved position estimation
We present a new algorithm that uses the randomness of the noise pattern to
	achieve high positioning accuracy by applying a modified averaging
	operation. Using the suggested approach, noise sensitivity of the
	positioning accuracy can be significantly reduced. This new improved
	algorithm can improve the performances of tracking systems used for
	military as well as civil applications. The concept is demonstrated
	theoretically as well as by optical experiment
