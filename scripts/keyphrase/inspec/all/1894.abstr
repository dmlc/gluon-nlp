Switching controller design via convex polyhedral Lyapunov functions
We propose a systematic switching control design method for a class of
	nonlinear discrete time hybrid systems. The novelty of the adopted
	approach is in the fact that unlike conventional control the control
	burden is shifted to a logical level thus creating the need for the
	development of new analysis/design methods
