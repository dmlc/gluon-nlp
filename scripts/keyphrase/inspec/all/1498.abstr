John McCarthy: father of AI
If John McCarthy, the father of AI, were to coin a new phrase for "artificial
	intelligence" today, he would probably use "computational
	intelligence." McCarthy is not just the father of AI, he is also the
	inventor of the Lisp (list processing) language. The author considers
	McCarthy's conception of Lisp and discusses McCarthy's recent research
	that involves elaboration tolerance, creativity by machines, free will
	of machines, and some improved ways of doing situation calculus
