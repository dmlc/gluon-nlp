Decisions, decisions, decisions: a tale of special collections in the small
	academic library
A case study of a special collections department in a small academic library
	and how its collections have been acquired and developed over the years
	is described. It looks at the changes that have occurred in the
	academic environment and what effect, if any, these changes may have
	had on the department and how it has adapted to them. It raises
	questions about development and acquisitions policies and procedures
