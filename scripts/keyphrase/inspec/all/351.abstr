Optimal online algorithm for scheduling on two identical machines with machine
	availability constraints
This paper considers the online scheduling on two identical machines with
	machine availability constraints for minimizing makespan. We assume
	that machine M/sub j/ is unavailable during period from s/sub j/ to
	t/sub j/ (0 <or= s/sub j/ < t/sub j/), j = 1, 2, and the
	unavailable periods of two machines do not overlap. We show that the
	competitive ratio of list scheduling is 3. We further give an optimal
	algorithm with a competitive ratio 5/2
