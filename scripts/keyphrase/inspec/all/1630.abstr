Digital-domain self-calibration technique for video-rate pipeline A/D
	converters using Gaussian white noise
A digital-domain self-calibration technique for video-rate pipeline A/D
	converters based on a Gaussian white noise input signal is presented.
	The proposed algorithm is simple and efficient. A design example is
	shown to illustrate that the overall linearity of a pipeline ADC can be
	highly improved using this technique
