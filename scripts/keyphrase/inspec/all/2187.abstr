Variable structure intelligent control for PM synchronous servo motor drive
The variable structure control (VSC) of discrete time systems based on
	intelligent control is presented in this paper. A novel approach is
	proposed for the state estimation. A linear observer is firstly
	designed. Then a neural network is used for compensating uncertainty.
	The parameter of the VSC scheme is adjusted online by a neural network.
	Practical operating results from a PM synchronous motor (PMSM)
	illustrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed
	approach
