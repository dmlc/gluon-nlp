Adaptive image enhancement for retinal blood vessel segmentation
Retinal blood vessel images are enhanced by removing the nonstationary
	background, which is adaptively estimated based on local neighbourhood
	information. The result is a much better segmentation of the blood
	vessels with a simple algorithm and without the need to obtain a priori
	illumination knowledge of the imaging system
