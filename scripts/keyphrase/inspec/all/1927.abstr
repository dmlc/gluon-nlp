Optimal strategies for a semi-Markovian inventory system
Control for a semi-Markovian inventory system is considered. Under general
	assumptions on system functioning, conditions for existence of an
	optimal nonrandomized Markovian strategy are found. It is shown that
	under some additional assumptions on storing conditions for the
	inventory, the optimal strategy has a threshold (s, S)-frame
