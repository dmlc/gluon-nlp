A note on multi-index polynomials of Dickson type and their applications in
	quantum optics
We discuss the properties of a new family of multi-index Lucas type
	polynomials, which are often encountered in problems of intracavity
	photon statistics. We develop an approach based on the integral
	representation method and show that this class of polynomials can be
	derived from recently introduced multi-index Hermite like polynomials
