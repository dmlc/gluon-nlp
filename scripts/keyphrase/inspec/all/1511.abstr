Efficient algorithms for stiff elliptic problems with large parameters
We consider a finite element approximation and iteration algorithms for solving
	stiff elliptic boundary value problems with large parameters in front
	of a higher derivative. The convergence rate of the algorithms is
	independent of the spread in coefficients and a discretization
	parameter
