Stabilization of a linear object by frequency-modulated pulsed signals
A control system consisting of an unstable continuous linear part and a
	pulse-frequency modulator in the feedback circuit is studied.
	Conditions for the boundedness of the solutions of the system under any
	initial data are determined
