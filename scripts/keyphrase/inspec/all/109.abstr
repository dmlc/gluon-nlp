An entanglement measure based on the capacity of dense coding
An asymptotic entanglement measure for any bipartite states is derived in the
	light of the dense coding capacity optimized with respect to local
	quantum operations and classical communications. General properties and
	some examples with explicit forms of this entanglement measure are
	investigated
