Learning weights for the quasi-weighted means
We study the determination of weights for quasi-weighted means (also called
	quasi-linear means) when a set of examples is given. We consider first
	a simple case, the learning of weights for weighted means, and then we
	extend the approach to the more general case of a quasi-weighted mean.
	We consider the case of a known arbitrary generator f. The paper
	finishes considering the use of parametric functions that are suitable
	when the values to aggregate are measure values or ratio
