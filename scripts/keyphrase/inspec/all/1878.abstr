Max and min limiters
If A contained in omega , n>or=2, and the function max({x/sub 1/,...,x/sub
	n/} intersection A) is partial recursive, it is easily seen that A is
	recursive. In this paper, we weaken this hypothesis in various ways
	(and similarly for "min" in place of "max") and investigate what effect
	this has on the complexity of A. We discover a sharp contrast between
	retraceable and co-retraceable sets, and we characterize sets which are
	the union of a recursive set and a co-r.e., retraceable set. Most of
	our proofs are noneffective. Several open questions are raised
