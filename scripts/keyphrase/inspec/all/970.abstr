Complex dynamics in nearly symmetric three-cell cellular neural networks
The paper introduces a class of third-order nonsymmetric Cellular Neural
	Networks (CNNs), and shows through computer simulations that they
	undergo a cascade of period doubling bifurcations which leads to the
	birth of a large-size complex attractor. A major point is that these
	bifurcations and complex dynamics happen in a small neighborhood of a
	particular CNN with a symmetric interconnection matrix
