Why your Web strategy is, err, wrong
An awkward look at a few standard views from the author, who thinks that most
	people have got it, err, wrong. Like every other investment, when the
	time comes to sign the contract, the question that should be asked is
	not whether it is a good investment, but whether it is the best
	investment the firm can make with the money. the author argues that he
	would be surprised if any law firm Web site he has seen yet would jump
	that particular hurdle
