Non-optimal universal quantum deleting machine
We verify the non-existence of some standard universal quantum deleting
	machine. Then a non-optimal universal quantum deleting machine is
	constructed and we emphasize the difficulty for improving its fidelity.
	In a way, our results complement the universal quantum cloning machine
	established by Buzek and Hillery (1996), and manifest some of their
	distinctions
