A framework of electronic tendering for government procurement: a lesson
	learned in Taiwan
To render government procurement efficient, transparent, nondiscriminating, and
	accountable, an electronic government procurement system is required.
	Accordingly, Taiwan government procurement law (TGPL) states that
	suppliers may employ electronic devices to forward a tender. This
	investigation demonstrates how the electronic government procurement
	system functions and reengineers internal procurement processes, which
	in turn benefits both government bodies and vendors. The system
	features explored herein include posting/receiving bids via the
	Internet, vendor registration, certificate authorization, contract
	development tools, bid/request for proposal (RFP) development, online
	bidding, and online payment, all of which can be integrated easily
	within most existing information infrastructures
