Modifier formula on mean square convergence of LMS algorithm
In describing the mean square convergence of the LMS algorithm, the update
	formula based on independence assumption will bring explicit errors,
	especially when step-size is large. A modifier formula that describes
	the convergence well, is proposed. Simulations support the proposed
	formula in different conditions
