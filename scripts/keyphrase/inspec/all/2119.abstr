Location of transport nets on a heterogeneous territory
The location of transport routes on a heterogeneous territory is studied. The
	network joins a given set of terminal points and a certain number of
	additional (branch) points. The problem is formulated, properties of
	the optimal solution for a. tree-like network, and the number of branch
	points are studied. A stepwise optimization algorithm for a. network
	with given adjacency matrix based on an algorithm for constructing
	minimal-cost routes is designed
