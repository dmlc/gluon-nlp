Formula-dependent equivalence for compositional CTL model checking
We present a polytime computable state equivalence that is defined with respect
	to a given CTL formula. Since it does not attempt to preserve all CTL
	formulas, like bisimulation does, we can expect to compute coarser
	equivalences. This equivalence can be used to reduce the complexity of
	model checking a system of interacting FSM. Additionally, we show that
	in some cases our techniques can detect if a formula passes or fails,
	without forming the entire product machine. The method is exact and
	fully automatic, and handles full CTL
