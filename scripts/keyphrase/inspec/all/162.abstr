International news sites in English
Web access to news sites all over the world allows us the opportunity to have
	an electronic news stand readily available and stocked with a variety
	of foreign (to us) news sites. A large number of currently available
	foreign sites are English-language publications or English language
	versions of non-North American sites. These sites are quite varied in
	terms of quality, coverage, and style. Finding them can present a
	challenge. Using them effectively requires critical-thinking skills
	that are a part of media awareness or digital literacy
