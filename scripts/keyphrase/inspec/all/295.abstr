Hours of operation and service in academic libraries: toward a national
	standard
In an effort toward establishing a standard for academic library hours, the
	article surveys and compares hours of operation and service for ARL
	libraries and IPEDS survey respondents. The article ranks the ARL
	(Association for Research Libraries) libraries according to hours of
	operation and reference hours and then briefly discusses such issues as
	libraries offering twenty-four access and factors affecting service
	hour decisions
