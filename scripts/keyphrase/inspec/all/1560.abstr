Determinantal solutions of solvable chaotic systems
It is shown that two solvable chaotic systems, the arithmetic-harmonic mean
	(ARM) algorithm and the Ulam-von Neumann (UvN) map, have determinantal
	solutions. An additional formula for certain determinants and Riccati
	difference equations play a key role in both cases. Two infinite
	hierarchies of solvable chaotic systems are presented which have
	determinantal solutions
