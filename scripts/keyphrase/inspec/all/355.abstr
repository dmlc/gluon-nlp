An identity-based society oriented signature scheme with anonymous signers
In this paper, we propose a new society oriented scheme, based on the
	Guillou-Quisquater (1989) signature scheme. The scheme is
	identity-based and the signatures are verified with respect to only one
	identity. That is, the verifier does not have to know the identity of
	the co-signers, but just that of the organization they represent
