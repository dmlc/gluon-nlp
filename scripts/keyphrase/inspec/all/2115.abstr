Control of combustion processes in an internal combustion engine by
	low-temperature plasma
A new method of operation of internal combustion engines enhances power and
	reduces fuel consumption and exhaust toxicity. Low-temperature plasma
	control combines working processes of thermal engines and steam
	machines into a single process
