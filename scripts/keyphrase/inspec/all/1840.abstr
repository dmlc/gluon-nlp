Too much middleware
The movement from client-server computing to multi-tier computing has created a
	potpourri of so-called middleware systems, including application
	servers, workflow products, EAI systems, ETL systems and federated data
	systems. We argue that the explosion in middleware has created a myriad
	of poorly integrated systems with overlapping functionality. The world
	would be well served by considerable consolidation, and we present some
	of the ways this might happen. Some of the points covered in the
	article have been previously explored by P. Bernstein (1996)
