Modularity in technology and organization
The paper is an attempt to raid both the literature on modular design and the
	literature on property rights to create the outlines of a modularity
	theory of the firm. Such a theory will look at firms, and other
	organizations, in terms of the partitioning of rights-understood as
	protected spheres of authority-among cooperating parties. It will
	assert that organizations reflect nonmodular structures, that is,
	structures in which decision rights, rights of alienation, and residual
	claims to income do not all reside in the same hands
