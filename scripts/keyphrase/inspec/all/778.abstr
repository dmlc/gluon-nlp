Access matters
Discusses accessibility needs of people with disabilities, both from the
	perspective of getting the information from I&R programs (including
	accessible Web sites, TTY access, Braille, and other mechanisms) and
	from the perspective of being aware of accessibility needs when
	referring clients to resources. Includes information on ADA legislation
	requiring accessibility to public places and recommends several
	organizations and Web sites for additional information
