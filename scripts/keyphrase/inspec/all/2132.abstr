Fault-tolerant computer-aided control systems with multiversion-threshold
	adaptation: adaptation methods, reliability estimation, and choice of
	an architecture
For multiversion majority-redundant computer-aided control systems,
	systematization of adaptation methods that are stable to hardware and
	software failures, a method for estimating their reliability from an
	event graph model, and a method for selecting a standard architecture
	with regard for reliability requirements are studied
