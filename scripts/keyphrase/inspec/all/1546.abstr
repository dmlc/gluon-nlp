Necessary conditions of optimality for impulsive systems on Banach spaces
We present necessary conditions of optimality for optimal control problems
	arising in systems governed by impulsive evolution equations on Banach
	spaces. Basic notations and terminologies are first presented and
	necessary conditions of optimality are presented. Special cases are
	discussed and we present an application to the classical linear
	quadratic regulator problem
