Cooperative mutation based evolutionary programming for continuous function
	optimization
An evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm adapting a new mutation operator is
	presented. Unlike most previous EPs, in which each individual is
	mutated on its own, each individual in the proposed algorithm is
	mutated in cooperation with the other individuals. This not only
	enhances convergence speed but also gives more chance to escape from
	local minima
