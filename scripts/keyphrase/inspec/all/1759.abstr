On the p-adic Birch, Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture for non-semistable reduction
In this paper, we examine the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves E with additive
	reduction at an odd prime p. By extending Perrin-Riou's theory to
	certain nonsemistable representations, we are able to convert Kato's
	zeta-elements into p-adic L-functions. This allows us to deduce the
	cotorsion of the Selmer group over the cyclotomic Z/sub p/-extension of
	Q, and thus prove an inequality in the p-adic Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
	conjecture at primes p whose square divides the conductor of E
