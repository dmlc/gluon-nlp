Transmission of real-time video over IP differentiated services
Multimedia applications require high bandwidth and guaranteed quality of
	service (QoS). The current Internet, which provides 'best effort'
	services, cannot meet the stringent QoS requirements for delivering
	MPEG videos. It is proposed that MPEG frames are transported through
	various service models of DiffServ. Performance analysis and simulation
	results show that the proposed approach can not only guarantee QoS but
	can also achieve high bandwidth utilisation
