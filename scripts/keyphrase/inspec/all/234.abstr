The UK's National Electronic Site Licensing Initiative (NESLI)
In 1998 the UK created the National Electronic Site Licensing Initiative
	(NESLI) to increase and improve access to electronic journals and to
	negotiate license agreements on behalf of academic libraries. The use
	of a model license agreement and the success of site licensing is
	discussed. Highlights from an interim evaluation by the Joint
	Information Systems Committee (JISC) are noted and key issues and
	questions arising from the evaluation are identified
