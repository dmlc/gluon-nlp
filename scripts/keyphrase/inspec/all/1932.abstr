Solution of the safe problem on (0,1)-matrices
A safe problem with mn locks is studied. It is reduced to a system of linear
	equations in the modulo 2 residue class. There are three possible
	variants defined by the numbers m and n evenness, with only one of them
	having a solution. In two other cases, correction of the initial state
	of the safe insuring a solution is proposed
