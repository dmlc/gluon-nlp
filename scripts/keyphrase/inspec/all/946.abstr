Entanglement measures with asymptotic weak-monotonicity as lower (upper) bound
	for the entanglement of cost (distillation)
We propose entanglement measures with asymptotic weak-monotonicity. We show
	that a normalized form of entanglement measures with the asymptotic
	weak-monotonicity are lower (upper) bound for the entanglement of cost
	(distillation)
