Single and multi-interval Legendre tau -methods in time for parabolic equations
In this paper, we take the parabolic equation with periodic boundary conditions
	as a model to present a spectral method with the Fourier approximation
	in spatial and single/multi-interval Legendre Petrov-Galerkin methods
	in time. For the single interval spectral method in time, we obtain the
	optimal error estimate in L/sup 2/-norm. For the multi-interval
	spectral method in time, the L/sup 2/-optimal error estimate is valid
	in spatial. Numerical results show the efficiency of the methods
