Mount Sinai Hospital uses integer programming to allocate operating room time
An integer-programming model and a post-solution heuristic allocates operating
	room time to the five surgical divisions at Toronto's Mount Sinai
	Hospital. The hospital has used this approach for several years and
	credits it with both administrative savings and the ability to produce
	quickly an equitable master surgical schedule
