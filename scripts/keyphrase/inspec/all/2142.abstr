Spectral characteristics of the linear systems over a bounded time interval
Consideration was given to the spectral characteristics of the linear dynamic
	systems over a bounded time interval. Singular characteristics of
	standard dynamic blocks, transcendental characteristic equations, and
	partial spectra of the singular functions were studied. Relationship
	between the spectra under study and the classical frequency
	characteristic was demonstrated
