Conditions for the local manipulation of Gaussian states
We present a general necessary and sufficient criterion for the possibility of
	a state transformation from one mixed Gaussian state to another of a
	bipartite continuous-variable system with two modes. The class of
	operations that will be considered is the set of local Gaussian
	completely positive trace-preserving maps
