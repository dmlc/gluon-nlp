Efficient cellular automata based versatile multiplier for GF(2/sup m/)
In this paper, a low-complexity programmable cellular automata (PCA) based
	versatile modular multiplier in GF(2/sup m/) is presented. The proposed
	versatile multiplier increases flexibility by using the same multiplier
	in different security environments, and it reduces the user's cost.
	Moreover, the multiplier can be easily extended to high order of m for
	more security, and low-cost serial implementation is feasible in
	restricted computing environments, such as smart cards and wireless
	devices
