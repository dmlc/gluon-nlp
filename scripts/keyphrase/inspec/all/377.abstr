MATLAB code for plotting ambiguity functions
A MATLAB code capable of plotting ambiguity functions of many different radar
	signals is presented. The program makes use of MATLAB's sparse matrix
	operations, and avoids loops. The program could be useful as a
	pedagogical tool in radar courses teaching pulse compression
