Regional flux target with minimum energy
An extension of a gradient controllability problem to the case where the target
	subregion is a part of the boundary of a parabolic system domain is
	discussed. A definition and some properties adapted to this case are
	presented. The focus is on the characterisation of the control
	achieving a regional boundary gradient target with minimum energy. An
	approach is developed that leads to a numerical algorithm for the
	computation of optimal control. Numerical illustrations show the
	efficiency of the approach and lead to conjectures
