Full-screen ultrafast video modes over-clocked by simple VESA routines and
	registers reprogramming under MS-DOS
Fast full-screen presentation of stimuli is necessary in psychological
	research. Although Spitczok von Brisinski (1994) introduced a method
	that achieved ultrafast display by reprogramming the registers, he
	could not produce an acceptable full-screen display. In this report,
	the author introduces a new method combining VESA routine calling with
	register reprogramming that can yield a display at 640 * 480
	resolution, with a refresh rate of about 150 Hz
