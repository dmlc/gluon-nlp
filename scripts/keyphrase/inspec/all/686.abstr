Technology CAD of SiGe-heterojunction field effect transistors
A 2D virtual wafer fabrication simulation suite has been employed for the
	technology CAD of SiGe channel heterojunction field effect transistors
	(HFETs). Complete fabrication process of SiGe p-HFETs has been
	simulated. The SiGe material parameters and mobility model were
	incorporated to simulate Si/SiGe p-HFETs with a uniform germanium
	channel having an L/sub eff/ of 0.5 mu m. A significant improvement in
	linear transconductance is observed when compared to control-silicon
	p-MOSFETs
