Mid-market accounting systems
Welcome to our fourth annual survey of accounting systems and enterprise
	resource planning (ERP) systems. Last September, we concentrated on
	financial and distribution systems for medium-sized businesses (mid
	market) and included 22 products in our charts. This year, we extended
	the products to include manufacturing and added 34 products to the list
