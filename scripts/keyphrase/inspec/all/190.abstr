On the design of gain-scheduled trajectory tracking controllers [AUV
	application]
A new methodology is proposed for the design of trajectory tracking controllers
	for autonomous vehicles. The design technique builds on gain scheduling
	control theory. An application is made to the design of a trajectory
	tracking controller for a prototype autonomous underwater vehicle
	(AUV). The effectiveness and advantages of the new control laws derived
	are illustrated in simulation using a full set of non-linear equations
	of motion of the vehicle
