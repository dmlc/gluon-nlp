Average optimization of the approximate solution of operator equations and its
	application
In this paper, a definition of the optimization of operator equations in the
	average case setting is given. And the general result about the
	relevant optimization problem is obtained. This result is applied to
	the optimization of approximate solution of some classes of integral
	equations
