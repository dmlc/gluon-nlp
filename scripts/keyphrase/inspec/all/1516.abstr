Using duality to implicitize and find cusps and inflection points of Bezier
	curves
A planar algebraic curve C has an implicit equation and a tangential equation.
	The tangential equation defines a dual curve to C. Starting with a
	parametrization of C, we find a parametrization of the dual curve, and
	the tangential equation and implicit equation of C in a novel way. We
	also find equations whose roots are the parameter values of the cusps
	and inflection points of C. Methods include polar reciprocation and the
	theory of envelopes
