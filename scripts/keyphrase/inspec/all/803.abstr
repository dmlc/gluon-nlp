The mutual effects of grid and wind turbine voltage stability control
This note considers the results of wind turbine modelling and power system
	stability investigations. Voltage stability of the power grid with
	grid-connected wind turbines will be improved by using blade angle
	control for a temporary reduction of the wind turbine power during and
	shortly after a short circuit fault in the grid
