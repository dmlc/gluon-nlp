Rapid Cauer filter design employing new filter model
The exact three-dimensional (3D) design of a coaxial Cauer filter employing a
	new filter model, a 3D field simulator and a circuit simulator, is
	demonstrated. Only a few iterations between the field simulator and the
	circuit simulator are necessary to meet a given specification
