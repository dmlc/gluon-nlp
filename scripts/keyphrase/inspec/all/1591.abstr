Quadratic interpolation on spheres
Riemannian quadratics are C/sup 1/ curves on Riemannian manifolds, obtained by
	performing the quadratic recursive deCastlejeau algorithm in a
	Riemannian setting. They are of interest for interpolation problems in
	Riemannian manifolds, such as trajectory-planning for rigid body
	motion. Some interpolation properties of Riemannian quadratics are
	analysed when the ambient manifold is a sphere or projective space,
	with the usual Riemannian metrics
