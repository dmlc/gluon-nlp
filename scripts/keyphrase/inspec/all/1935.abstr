Identification of states of complex systems with estimation of admissible
	measurement errors on the basis of fuzzy information
The problem of identification of states of complex systems on the basis of
	fuzzy values of informative attributes is considered. Some estimates of
	a maximally admissible degree of measurement error are obtained that
	make it possible, using the apparatus of fuzzy set theory, to correctly
	identify the current state of a system
