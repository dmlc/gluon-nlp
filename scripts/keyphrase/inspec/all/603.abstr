PGE helps customers reduce energy costs
A new service from Portland General Electric (PGE, Portland, Oregon, US) is
	saving customers tens of thousands of dollars in energy costs. PGE
	created E-Manager to allow facility managers to analyze their energy
	consumption online at 15-minute intervals. Customers can go to the Web
	for complete data, powerful analysis tools and charts, helping them
	detect abnormal energy use and focus on costly problem areas
