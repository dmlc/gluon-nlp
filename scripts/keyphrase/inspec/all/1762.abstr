Laguerre pseudospectral method for nonlinear partial differential equations
The Laguerre Gauss-Radau interpolation is investigated. Some approximation
	results are obtained. As an example, the Laguerre pseudospectral scheme
	is constructed for the BBM equation. The stability and the convergence
	of proposed scheme are proved. The numerical results show the high
	accuracy of this approach
