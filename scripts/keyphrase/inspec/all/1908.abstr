Explicit solutions for transcendental equations
A simple method to formulate an explicit expression for the roots of any
	analytic transcendental function is presented. The method is based on
	Cauchy's integral theorem and uses only basic concepts of complex
	integration. A convenient method for numerically evaluating the exact
	expression is presented. The application of both the formulation and
	evaluation of the exact expression is illustrated for several classical
	root finding problems
