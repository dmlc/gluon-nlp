Analyzing the benefits of 300 mm conveyor-based AMHS
While the need for automation in 300 mm fabs is not debated, the form and
	performance of such automation is still in question. Software
	simulation that compares conveyor-based continuous flow transport
	technology to conventional car-based wafer-lot delivery has detailed
	delivery time and throughput advantages to the former
