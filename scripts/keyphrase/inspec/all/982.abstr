Abundance of mosaic patterns for CNN with spatially variant templates
This work investigates the complexity of one-dimensional cellular neural
	network mosaic patterns with spatially variant templates on finite and
	infinite lattices. Various boundary conditions are considered for
	finite lattices and the exact number of mosaic patterns is computed
	precisely. The entropy of mosaic patterns with periodic templates can
	also be calculated for infinite lattices. Furthermore, we show the
	abundance of mosaic patterns with respect to template periods and,
	which differ greatly from cases with spatially invariant templates
