Self-validating integration and approximation of piecewise analytic functions
Let an analytic or a piecewise analytic function on a compact interval be
	given. We present algorithms that produce enclosures for the integral
	or the function itself. Under certain conditions on the representation
	of the function, this is done with the minimal order of numbers of
	operations. The integration algorithm is implemented and numerical
	comparisons to non-validating integration software are presented
