On the distribution of Lachlan nonsplitting bases
We say that a computably enumerable (c.e.) degree b is a Lachlan nonsplitting
	base (LNB), if there is a computably enumerable degree a such that
	a>b, and for any c.e. degrees w, v<or=a, if a<or=wVvV b then
	either a<or=wV b or a<or=vV b. In this paper we investigate the
	relationship between bounding and nonbounding of Lachlan nonsplitting
	bases and the high/low hierarchy. We prove that there is a non-Low/sub
	2/ c.e. degree which bounds no Lachlan nonsplitting base
