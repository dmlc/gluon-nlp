Dynamic modification of object Petri nets. An application to modelling
	protocols with fork-join structures
In this paper we discuss possibilities of modelling protocols by objects in
	object-based high-level Petri nets. Some advantages of dynamically
	modifying the structure of token objects are discussed and the need for
	further investigations into mathematically rigorous foundations of
	object net formalisms incorporating facilities for such operations on
	its token nets is emphasised
