Rate allocation for video transmission over lossy correlated networks
A novel rate allocation algorithm for video transmission over lossy networks
	subject to bursty packet losses is presented. A Gilbert-Elliot model is
	used at the encoder to drive the selection of coding parameters.
	Experimental results using the H.26L test model show a significant
	performance improvement with respect to the assumption of independent
	packet losses
