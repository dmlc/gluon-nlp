Enhancing the reliability of modular medium-voltage drives
A method to increase the reliability of modular medium-voltage induction motor
	drives is discussed, by providing means to bypass a failed module. The
	impact on reliability is shown. A control, which maximizes the output
	voltage available after bypass, is described, and experimental results
	are given
