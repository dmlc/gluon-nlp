Women of color in computing
It is well known that there is a need to increase the number of women in the
	area of computing, that is in computer science and computer
	engineering. If we consider women of color, that is women of
	under-represented ethnicities, we find the numbers are very dismal. The
	goal of this article is to bring to light the unique issues of women of
	color based upon the personal experience of one African-American woman
	who has been in the field of computing for over 20 years (including the
	years of higher education)
