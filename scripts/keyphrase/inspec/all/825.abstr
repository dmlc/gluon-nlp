Genetic algorithm-neural network estimation of Cobb angle from torso asymmetry
	in scoliosis
Scoliosis severity, measured by the Cobb angle, was estimated by artificial
	neural network from indices of torso surface asymmetry using a genetic
	algorithm to select the optimal set of input torso indices. Estimates
	of the Cobb angle were accurate within 5 degrees in two-thirds, and
	within 10 degrees in six-sevenths, of a test set of 115 scans of 48
	scoliosis patients, showing promise for future longitudinal studies to
	detect scoliosis progression without use of X-rays
