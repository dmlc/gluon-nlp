Electronic books: reports of their death have been exaggerated
E-books will survive, but not in the consumer market - at least not until
	reading devices become much cheaper and much better in quality (which
	is not likely to happen soon). Library Journal's review of major events
	of the year 2001 noted that two requirements for the success of E-books
	were development of a sustainable business model and development of
	better reading devices. The E-book revolution has therefore become more
	of an evolution. We can look forward to further developments and
	advances in the future
