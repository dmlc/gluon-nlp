A fuzzy logic adaptation circuit for control systems of deformable space
	vehicles: its design
A fuzzy-logic adaptation algorithm is designed for adjusting the discreteness
	period of a control system for ensuring the stability and quality of
	control process with regard to the elastic structural vibrations of a
	deformable space vehicle. Its performance is verified by digital
	modeling of a discrete control system with two objects
