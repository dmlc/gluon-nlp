Dihedral congruence primes and class fields of real quadratic fields
We show that for a real quadratic field F the dihedral congruence primes with
	respect to F for cusp forms of weight k and quadratic nebentypus are
	essentially the primes dividing expressions of the form epsilon /sub
	+//sup k-1/+or-1 where epsilon /sub +/ is a totally positive
	fundamental unit of F. This extends work of Hida. Our results allow us
	to identify a family of (ray) class fields of F which are generated by
	torsion points on modular abelian varieties
