A dynamic method for weighted linear least squares problems
A new method for solving the weighted linear least squares problems with full
	rank is proposed. Based on the theory of Liapunov's stability, the
	method associates a dynamic system with a weighted linear least squares
	problem, whose solution we are interested in and integrates the former
	numerically by an A-stable numerical method. The numerical tests
	suggest that the new method is more than comparative with current
	conventional techniques based on the normal equations
