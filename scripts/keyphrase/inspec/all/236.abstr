Licensing experiences in the Netherlands
The licensing strategy of university libraries in the Netherlands is closely
	connected with university policies to develop document servers and to
	make research publications available on the Web. National agreements
	have been made with major publishers, such as Elsevier Science and
	Kluwer Academic, to provide access to a wide range of scientific
	information and to experiment with new ways of providing information
	and new business models
