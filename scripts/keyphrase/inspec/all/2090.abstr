All-optical logic NOR gate using two-cascaded semiconductor optical amplifiers
The authors present a novel all-optical logic NOR gate using two-cascaded
	semiconductor optical. amplifiers (SOAs) in a counterpropagating
	feedback configuration. This configuration accentuates the gain
	nonlinearity due to the mutual gain modulation of the two SOAs. The
	all-optical NOR gate feasibility has been demonstrated delivering an
	extinction ratio higher than 12 dB over a wide range of wavelength
