A quantum full adder for a scalable nuclear spin quantum computer
We demonstrate a strategy for implementation a quantum full adder in a spin
	chain quantum computer. As an example, we simulate a quantum full adder
	in a chain containing 201 spins. Our simulations also demonstrate how
	one can minimize errors generated by non-resonant effects
