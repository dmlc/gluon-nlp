Computational finite-element schemes for optimal control of an elliptic system
	with conjugation conditions
New optimal control problems are considered for distributed systems described
	by elliptic equations with conjugate conditions and a quadratic
	minimized function. Highly accurate computational discretization
	schemes are constructed for the case where a feasible control set u/sub
	delta / coincides with the full Hilbert space u of controls
