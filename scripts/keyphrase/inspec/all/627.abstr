Comparison of non-stationary time series in the frequency domain
In this paper we compare two nonstationary time series using nonparametric
	procedures. Evolutionary spectra are estimated for the two series.
	Randomization tests are performed on groups of spectral estimates for
	both related and independent time series. Simulation studies show that
	in certain cases the tests perform reasonably well. The tests are
	applied to observed geological and financial time series
