Tracking with sensor failures
Studies the reliability with sensor failures of the asymptotic tracking problem
	for linear time invariant systems using the factorization approach. The
	plant is two-output and the compensator is two-degree-of-freedom.
	Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the general
	problem and a simple solution is given for problems with stable plants
