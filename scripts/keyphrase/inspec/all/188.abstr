Sampled-data implementation of a gain scheduled controller
A continuous-time gain-scheduled controller must be transformed to a
	corresponding discrete-time controller for sampled-data implementation.
	We show that certain linearization properties of a continuous-time gain
	scheduled controller are inherited by its sampled-data implementation.
	We also show that a similar relationship exists for multi-rate gain
	scheduled controllers arising in flight control applications
