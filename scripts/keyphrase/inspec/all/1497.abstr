Research challenges and perspectives of the Semantic Web
Accessing documents and services on today's Web requires human intelligence.
	The interface to these documents and services is the Web page, written
	in natural language, which humans must understand and act upon. The
	paper discusses the Semantic Web which will augment the current Web
	with formalized knowledge and data that computers can process. In the
	future, some services will mix human-readable and structured data so
	that both humans and computers can use them. Others will support
	formalized knowledge that only machines will use
