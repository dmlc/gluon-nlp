Pontryagin maximum principle of optimal control governed by fluid dynamic
	systems with two point boundary state constraint
We study the optimal control problem subject to the semilinear equation with a
	state constraint. We prove certain theorems and give examples of state
	constraints so that the maximum principle holds. The main difficulty of
	the problem is to make the sensitivity analysis of the state with
	respect to the control caused by the unboundedness and nonlinearity of
	an operator
