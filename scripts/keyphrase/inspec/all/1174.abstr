Optimization of cutting conditions for single pass turning operations using a
	deterministic approach
An optimization analysis, strategy and CAM software for the selection of
	economic cutting conditions in single pass turning operations are
	presented using a deterministic approach. The optimization is based on
	criteria typified by the maximum production rate and includes a host of
	practical constraints. It is shown that the deterministic optimization
	approach involving mathematical analyses of constrained economic trends
	and graphical representation on the feed-speed domain provides a
	clearly defined strategy that not only provides a unique global optimum
	solution, but also the software that is suitable for on-line CAM
	applications. A numerical study has verified the developed optimization
	strategies and software and has shown the economic benefits of using
	optimization
