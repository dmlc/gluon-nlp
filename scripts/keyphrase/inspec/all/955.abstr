From the DOS dog days to e-filing [law firms]
The poster child for a successful e-filing venture is the Case Management and
	Electronic Case File system now rolling through the district and
	bankruptcy courts. A project of the Administrative Office of the United
	States Courts, CM/ECF is a loud proponent of the benefits of the PDF
	approach and it has a full head of steam. Present plans are for all
	federal courts to implement CM/ECF by 2005. That means a radical shift
	in methodology and tools for a lot of lawyers. It also means that you
	should get cozy with Acrobat real soon
