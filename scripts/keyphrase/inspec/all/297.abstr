The service side of systems librarianship
Describes the role of a systems librarian at a small academic library. Although
	online catalogs and the Internet are making library accessibility more
	convenient, the need for library buildings and professionals has not
	diminished. Typical duties of a systems librarian and the effects of
	new technology on librarianship are discussed. Services provided to
	other constituencies on campus and the blurring relationship between
	the library and computer services are also presented
