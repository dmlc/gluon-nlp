Tool and process improvements from MFC control system technology
A new approach to MFC calibration links the physical parameters of nitrogen to
	the physical characteristics of various process gases. This precludes
	the conventional need for surrogate gases. What results is a
	physics-based tuning algorithm and enhanced digital control system that
	enables rearranging and gas change of digital MFCs. The end result
	should be better process control through more accurate gas flow. The
	new method also decreases the number of MFC spare parts required to
	back up a fab
