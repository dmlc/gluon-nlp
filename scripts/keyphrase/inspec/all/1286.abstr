Self-describing Turing machines
After a sketchy historical account on the question of self-describeness and
	self-reproduction, and after discussing the definition of suitable
	encodings for self-describeness, we give the construction of several
	self-describing Turing machines, namely self-describing machines with,
	respectively, 350, 267, 224 and 206 instructions
