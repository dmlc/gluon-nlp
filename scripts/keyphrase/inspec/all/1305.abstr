Learning nonregular languages: a comparison of simple recurrent networks and
	LSTM
Rodriguez (2001) examined the learning ability of simple recurrent nets (SRNs)
	(Elman, 1990) on simple context-sensitive and context-free languages.
	In response to Rodriguez's (2001) article, we compare the performance
	of simple recurrent nets and long short-term memory recurrent nets on
	context-free and context-sensitive languages
