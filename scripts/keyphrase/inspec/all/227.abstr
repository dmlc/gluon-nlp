Relativistic constraints on the distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states
The constraints imposed by special relativity on the distinguishability of
	quantum states are discussed. An explicit expression relating the
	probability of an error in distinguishing two orthogonal single-photon
	states to their structure, the time t at which a measurement starts,
	and the interval of time T elapsed from the start of the measurement
	until the time at which the outcome is obtained by an observer is given
	as an example
