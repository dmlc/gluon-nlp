Design patterns for high availability
It is possible to achieve five-nines reliability with everyday
	commercial-quality hardware and software. The key is the way in which
	these components are combined. The design of high availability systems
	is based on a combination of redundant hardware components and software
	to manage fault detection and correction without human intervention.
	The author quickly reviews some definitions tied to high availability
	and fault management, and then goes on to discuss some hardware and
	software design patterns for fault tolerant systems
