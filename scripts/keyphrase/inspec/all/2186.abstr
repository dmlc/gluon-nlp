Strategies for high throughput, templated zeolite synthesis
The design and redesign of high throughput experiments for zeolite synthesis
	are addressed. A model that relates materials function to the chemical
	composition of the zeolite and the structure directing agent is
	introduced. Using this model, several Monte Carlo-like design protocols
	are evaluated. Multi-round protocols are bound to be effective, and
	strategies that use a priori information about the structure-directing
	libraries are found to be the best
