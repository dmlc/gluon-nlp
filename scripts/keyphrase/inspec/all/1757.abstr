Even unimodular Gaussian lattices of rank 12
We classify even unimodular Gaussian lattices of rank 12, that is, even
	unimodular integral lattices of rank 12 over the ring of Gaussian
	integers. This is equivalent to the classification of the automorphisms
	tau with tau /sup 2/=-1 in the automorphism groups of all the Niemeier
	lattices, which are even unimodular (real) integral lattices of rank
	24. There are 28 even unimodular Gaussian lattices of rank 12 up to
	equivalence
