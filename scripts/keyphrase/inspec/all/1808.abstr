Nonlinearities in NARX polynomial models: representation and estimation
It is shown how nonlinearities are mapped in NARX polynomial models. General
	expressions are derived for the gain and eigenvalue functions in terms
	of the regressors and coefficients of NARX models. Such relationships
	are useful in grey-box identification problems. The results are
	illustrated using simulated and real data
