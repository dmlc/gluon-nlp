Robot trajectory control using neural networks
The use of a new type of neural network (NN) for controlling the trajectory of
	a robot is discussed. A control system is described which comprises an
	NN-based controller and a fixed-gain feedback controller. The NN-based
	controller employs a modified recurrent NN, the weights of which are
	obtained by training another NN to identify online the inverse dynamics
	of the robot. The work has confirmed the superiority of the proposed
	NN-based control system in rejecting large disturbances
