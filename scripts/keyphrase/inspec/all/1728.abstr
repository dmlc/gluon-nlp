A characterization of generalized Pareto distributions by progressive censoring
	schemes and goodness-of-fit tests
In this paper we generalize a characterization property of generalized Pareto
	distributions, which is known for ordinary order statistics, to
	arbitrary schemes of progressive type-II censored order statistics.
	Various goodness-of-fit tests for generalized Pareto distributions
	based on progressively censored data statistics are discussed
