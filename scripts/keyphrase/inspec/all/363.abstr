Synthetic simultaneity - natural and artificial
In control loops, each element introduces time delays. If those time delays are
	larger than the critical times for control of the system, a problem
	exists. I show a simple approach to mitigating this problem by basing
	the controller's decisions not on the observations themselves but on
	our projections as to what the observations will be at the time our
	controls reach the controlled system. Finally, I argue that synthetic
	simultaneity explains Libet's (1993) results better than Libet's
	explanation
