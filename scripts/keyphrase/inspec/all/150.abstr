Model checking games for branching time logics
This paper defines and examines model checking games for the branching time
	temporal logic CTL*. The games employ a technique called focus which
	enriches sets by picking out one distinguished element. This is
	necessary to avoid ambiguities in the regeneration of temporal
	operators. The correctness of these games is proved, and optimizations
	are considered to obtain model checking games for important fragments
	of CTL*. A game based model checking algorithm that matches the known
	lower and upper complexity bounds is sketched
