A switching synchronization scheme for a class of chaotic systems
In this Letter, we propose an observer-based synchronization scheme for a class
	of chaotic systems. This class of systems are given by piecewise-linear
	dynamics. By using some properties of such systems, we give a procedure
	to construct the gain of the observer. We prove various stability
	results and comment on the robustness of the proposed scheme. We also
	present some simulation results
