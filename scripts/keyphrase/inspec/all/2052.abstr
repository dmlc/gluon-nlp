Blitzograms - interactive histograms
As computers become ever faster, more and more procedures that were once viewed

	among both students and managers. And this is not just an academic
	exercise. Commercial Monte Carlo simulation packages like @RISK and
	Crystal Ball, and my INSIGHT.xla are widely available
