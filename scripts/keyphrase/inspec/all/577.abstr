A robust H/sub infinity / control approach for induction motors
This paper deals with the robustness and stability of an induction motor
	control structure against internal and external disturbances. In the
	proposed control scheme, we have used an H/sub infinity / controller
	with field orientation and input-output linearization to achieve the
	above-specified features. Simulation results are included to illustrate
	the control approach performances
