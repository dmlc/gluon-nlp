A second order characteristic finite element scheme for convection-diffusion
	problems
A new characteristic finite element scheme is presented for
	convection-diffusion problems. It is of second order accuracy in time
	increment, symmetric, and unconditionally stable. Optimal error
	estimates are proved in the framework of L/sup 2/-theory. Numerical
	results are presented for two examples, which show the advantage of the
	scheme
