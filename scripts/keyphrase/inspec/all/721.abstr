The results of experimental studies of the reflooding of fuel-rod assemblies
	from above and problems for future investigations
Problems in studying the reflooding of assemblies from above conducted at
	foreign and Russian experimental installations are considered. The
	efficiency of cooling and flow reversal under countercurrent flow of
	steam and water, as well as the scale effect are analyzed. The tasks
	for future experiments that are necessary for the development of modern
	correlations for the loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) computer codes are
	stated
