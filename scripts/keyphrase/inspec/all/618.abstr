Blind source separation applied to image cryptosystems with dual encryption
Blind source separation (BSS) is explored to add another encryption level
	besides the existing encryption methods for image cryptosystems. The
	transmitted images are covered with a noise image by specific mixing
	before encryption and then recovered through BSS after decryption.
	Simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed method
