An interactive self-replicator implemented in hardware
Self-replicating loops presented to date are essentially worlds unto
	themselves, inaccessible to the observer once the replication process
	is launched. We present the design of an interactive self-replicating
	loop of arbitrary size, wherein the user can physically control the
	loop's replication and induce its destruction. After introducing the
	BioWall, a reconfigurable electronic wall for bio-inspired
	applications, we describe the design of our novel loop and delineate
	its hardware implementation in the wall
