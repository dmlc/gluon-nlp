According to the UK media, Admiral William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, said that even though the US Navy was reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its navy -- the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific.
According to the reports from the site of "Jane's Defence Weekly" on September 24, China and Russia were classified as the strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning of the year.
Then, the US Navy recommissioned the Second Fleet to stand up against the Russian activities more directly.
It was reported that these actions raised some doubts and concerns among its allies and analysts. They were afraid that the US Navy might go far away from the strategy of "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific", which marked the Obama administration.
However, Admiral William Moran said that the focus of the US Navy would still focus on the West Pacific.
At the round-table discussion, which was hosted by National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there are any significant changes. "
Moran said: "The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it. "
But he admitted that the United States kept close relations with Europe.
He said: "We would continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast. "
Although he pointed out that the overall policy about Russia fell within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians might face the demographic and economic challenges, but the history demonstrates that they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. "
Admiral Moran said that as a part of the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a "new campaign mode". This would help to make the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the American aircraft carrier battle group or other assets at any specified time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictable battle. We should not show up at the same place again and again like clockwork. -- This is our approach. "
It was reported that the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group, and its early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed.
Moran said that the US Navy was currently trying to ensure its allies to know that these warships would still patrol in the traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech in this event to indicate that the Australian army could seamlessly cooperate with the American aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy had planned to purchase another 9 frigates with the "Aegis" combat system.

Itochu recognized $1.3 billion impairment losses to the investment on CITIC Limited on Friday. Write-downs of this largest enterprise investment was made due to influences of tense China-US trade.
In May 2016, a man passed by the headquarter of Marubeni Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni said that the trade war struck Gavilon, the subordinate American cereal department, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of China-US trade frictions when announcing their latest performance, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's goods with the price of hundreds of billions of dollars. President Trump threatened to expand the scope of the tariff to more than $500 billion of goods imported from China if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu, said that the trade dispute might have greater impact on Chinese economy next year.
Itochu and Charoen Pokphand Group invested $10 billion to CITIC in 2015, gaining 20% stock equity.
Hachimura said that Itochu proposed 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) losses to this part of share holdings since it considered the share price of CITIC not to rise again.
Itochu maintains its profit prediction of 500 billion yen of the financial year ended 31 March, 2019.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on the soybeans imported from America in July, to counter the initiatives of Washington on trade frictions.
"Our cereal business has been struck by China-US trade frictions," the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu Nobuhiro Yabe said.
He said that Gavilon has terminated the financial transaction of its account since September.
Pat Burke, the spokesman of Gavilon, pointed out in the statement on Friday that the action of this company was "in the light of internal policy limits and due to lack of market opportunities. "
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to reduction of employment positions.
Itochu maintained its annual profit prediction of 230 billion yen, helped by pulp, papermaking and power generation.
Sumitomo published its profit increase by 16% from April to September on Thursday, emphasizing that "the trade problems between America and China lead to uncertainty. "
Mitsubishi Corporation made up-regulation of its annual profit prediction to the record level on Friday due to increased production of coking coal and increasing prices of oil, coal and other bulk commodity.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced its new business plan, aiming to increase profits in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 from estimated 640 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion)
Report on November 5 of China News A round-up report: the U.S. midterm election starts counting down.
On November 4, President Trump and his democratic opponents actively "drum up votes" on their core voters.
Both Parties indicated that voter turnout will be a key factor to influence the situation of election.
According to the report, in 48 hours before the Americans went to vote, Trump was busy attending the rally for the Republican candidate, while the former President Obama just arrived in Indiana to rally for Joe Donnelly, the Democratic candidate of the Federal Senate, who asked for emergency help for the situation of election, and to shout out his final pre-election appeal.
On November 4, Trump went to Maycomb, Georgia to rally for Brian Kemp, the state governor of Republicans. He said, "you must go to the polls and cast a vote. "
"The contrast in this election cannot be clearer. "
Voters’ political enthusiasm has boosted to a rare peak and early voting of some states has been far more than usual.
When successive American presidents face their first midterm elections, their parties tend to have fewer members of congress.
According to the new poll released by the "Washington Post" and the ABC News on Day 4, although the Democratic situation of election for the House of Representatives maintains an advantage, the Republicans could benefit from an economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security.
The poll indicates that more registered voters like the Democratic candidate of the House of Representatives than the Republican candidate with proportion of 50% versus 43%. However, it still falls down compared with leading of 14 percentage points in August.
According to the other poll made by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, the Democrats still take 7 percentage points ahead of the Republicans.
It is reported that Obama told the crowds at a rally for Senator Donnelly, "When people don't tell the truth, and words don't mean anything anymore, that's going to have evil consequences.
Democracy does not work when people can only desperately tell lies. "
"Now, the only way to stop the behaviors of these Republicans is you and your vote. "
The Democrats face the toughest situation of election in the Senate for decades, and now the Republicans hold more than half (51) of seats.
However, the situation of election in the House of Representatives is relatively advantageous, and the Democrats need to win 23 seats to take control of 435 seats of the House of Representatives.
According to the assessment of analysts from FiveThirtyEight.com, a website for predicting the situation of election, the possibility that the Democrats win the House of Representatives can reach up to 85%.

People’s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the current tide of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R&D and related protection work, and deeply explore the potential value of patents to occupy the market domination.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered numerous infringements crisis in patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the operator, Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintiff’s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the "First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chuxing APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that they are the patentees and inventors of the "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals", and the whole operation process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical solution of the patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement.
However, during the court’s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an eligible defendant. It only provided free downloads of the involved APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should not be included as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement of this case was not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved in the case was completely implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific’s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoju Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate evidence. The Court dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.’s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the case.
At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Interview with CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation Achieved Remarkable Results
"China’s science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the scientific field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the China News Service in Beijing, the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the cooperation in dealing with climate change to the "Eye of Heaven" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world famous innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that involves the trust of partners and the tradition of long-term cooperation. ", Marshall said.
In May of this year, China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ― China’s Eye of Heaven, installed the world’s first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This internationally most advanced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO’s many years of technical accumulation. When enabled, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is the contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds of years, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of them. "
Marshall believed that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development progress.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world. Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease and other problems are also the serious challenges we faced.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current problems. "
Marshall said that the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of the "One Belt One Road".
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for cooperation in science and technology for us. "
Marshall took the example that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method without using cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the achievements of our participation in the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. "

Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister North Korea, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening the distrust of the United States on North Korea and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "very kind actions" during the last year, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies
"However, we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If the United States doesn’t trust on us, we have no confidence in our national security. It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons under such circumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of North Korea about the opposition of United States to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Kim agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea must firstly abandon nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to loose the requirements for the international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘declaration of the end of the war’," Ri Yong Ho said.
"The thought that sanctions can make us kneel and beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who don't know us.
However, the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho did not mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he emphasized the three meetings between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President over the past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. "

After the tax reduction, the finished automobile tax rate of China’s automobile has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China’s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest to help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 1449 tax items of daily consumer goods.
The tax reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bound up with people’s need of better lives.
This time’s tax reduction not only involves lots of items but also has strong dynamics, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
November 1, tax reductions will be imposed on 1585 industrial product tax items of electromechanical devices, parts and raw materials.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs of some domestically industrial products with urgent needs can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, assist industrial upgrading, and contribute to enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also benefit for reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
Relevant person in charge of Customs Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council introduced that the above four times initiative tax reduction and the third step tax reduction implemented on this year’s July 1 in accordance with the results of the expansion of the information technology agreement negotiation will result in the overall tariff level fell from last year’s 9.8% to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches China’s developing country status and development stage.
According to the person in charge, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China’s trade in goods sector, the overall level of tariffs should be compatible with the stage of China’s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China’s trade in goods scale ranks first in the world, and it has already had the economic foundation to further expand its openness. However, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect means for compliance. The level of tariff should be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition. While overprotection goes against the industry development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustment must balance production needs with consumer demands.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand and contributes to the transformation and upgrading of the industry, and striving to increase the import of characteristic advantage products with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously improving the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance the financial revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of tax reductions, we must plan and coordinate the domestic and international markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China’s economy.
The principal stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China’s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China’s own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall planning and utilization of international and foreign resources to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the upgrading consumption needs of people.
This action and measure shows tfhat China will constantly pursue an opening up strategy of mutual benefit and win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the principle of free trade rule and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world to also allow China’s development to better benefit the world.
Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness condition. Serbian President and Russian President will meet to discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops had occupied the roadway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station under the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.
On September 29, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition.
Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders were still effective. Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly.
It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russia, Europe and other sides about the current situation, and would visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When he was asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a significant military conflict in our territory. "
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition just for the sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict. However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.
The Serbian army upgraded the defense readiness condition in connection with the two actions in Kosovo.
According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian people, who had been living there for generations, in recent days, but these arrested Serbian people didn't break any laws.
Vucic said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in the region and carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of the Department of the Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport center near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby. These areas were originally under the control of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make this military adventure. Since the Kosovo army had taken actions without notifying Serbia in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the western countries for their false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflict was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
For the ownership of Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian people had different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of its nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia had built its most powerful country here in the 12th century. However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
The Albanian people insisted that the Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors. Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian people's territory since ancient times.
The subjective political divisions contributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
The Albanian people in Kosovo first declared the independence of Albania in 1912.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey. The proportion of Serbian people was relatively rising. The actions of "taking back their own lands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian people. The contradiction between the two nations intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of Balkan.
The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and the Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. The Kosovo War broke out.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement. However, due to the historical grievances between the two nations and the geopolitical constraints, they failed to sign the agreement, which was in the control of different forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo. It exposed the conflict between the two nations again.
Power Communication Still in interruption. Difficulties in Rescue due to Strong Earthquakes with Tsunami in Indonesia.
According to figures released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency on the morning of the 30th, a devastating earthquake and the caused tsunami in the Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi caused 420 people on 28th.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that the figure is only preliminary statistics from the Palu in Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many damaged and collapsed hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings due to the earthquake have not been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections.
Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of Donggala Regency and the neighboring Sigi area are still “lonely islands" that cannot be reached, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kalla said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blockage, airport damage... The rescue work after strong earthquakes and tsunami is very difficult.
Due to power interruption, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu rely on fuel for power generation.
The roads entering and leaving the city are blocked due to landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tank trucks, are unable to enter, which makes the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry dispatched emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods packages from Central Sulawesi and Gorontalo adjacent to the earthquake region have not arrived in the disaster area.
The disaster relief materials transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through the air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to thecontrol tower and runways of the Palu Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been grounded to ensure the safety and security of the rescue. The airport is only used for the take-off and landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel.
Wiranto, the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the earthquake zone, demanded that the power supply and airport commercial flights be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operating of hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescuers, volunteers and aids can be transported to disaster areas.
On the 28th, several strong earthquakes occurred in Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia continuously. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time caused a tsunami, which caused Palu City, Donggala Regency and Sigi area occurred major disasters.
China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Li) -- A cloudless blue sky in the day and the red clouds at evening......Recently, Beijing kept in the mode of the most beautiful blue sky. Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tactics to show their pictures on social platforms and constantly make status updates to show their happinesses. They said that "the most beautiful skyline with a blue sky and white clouds was the best business card of Beijing".
Beijing had met the "bluest sky" since August.
It could be found anywhere in Beijing at any time that many residents were holding their smart phones or DSLR cameras to take pictures.
On social platforms, such as the microblog and WeChat Moments, people could see the different beauty of the Imperial Palace, Tian An Men, the Bird's Nest, Hutong, and various buildings against the blue sky in the net friends' cameras.
Some net friends said that such "landscape pictures" were the best city images of Beijing; and some net friends joked that if the blue sky remain the same for a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would surely be cured; some net friends even hoped that "the blue sky would last through the winter, spring and summer, providing Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons".
Why did the residents in Beijing particularly like to show the blue sky?
That's because they had been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the past. They looked forward to the blue sky eagerly. After starting the "Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in Beijing to continuously improve the air quality, there were less fog and haze, but more blue skies. The residents were joyful to see this. And they felt so happy with it.
The weather was fine in Beijing on National Day.
Most of 35 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing showed in green at 8:00 am, indicating the "Superior First Grade".
The photography competition with the theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by the residents on social platforms was still under way.
Why was the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing in August of this year, which created the best record for the same period in history of the recent five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 in September.
The major factor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent days. And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution control. It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region. These laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing released officially and implemented the "2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Beijing" in 2013.
According to this plan, the authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status as national capital, and promoted the works of clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions. 4923 coal fired boilers were eliminated in total.
Thus, Beijing became the first big city of achieving the full network of natural gasification in the Chinese mainland.
According to the data, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reached the standards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior First Grade increased by 25; the number of days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution significantly dropped.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in September on the basis of the analysis of a new round of PM2.5 source. According to the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and control, enhanced the delicacy management of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" permanently in Beijing. The sky would not "be precious", since it was rare. Let it return to be the background of people's photo album, but not the leading role.
During this year’s National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce Bureau, City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, Public Security Bureau and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six unlicensed" chaos in tourism, and once verified, the violations will be imposed on strict and serious punishment according to the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a thematic meeting on illegal "one-day tour" to deploy a special action to further crack down on illegal "one-day tour".
At the meeting, the focus was on the "six unlicensed" chaos that was intertwined with the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website profit chain. The city launched a special action for "one-day tour" on July 28th.
Since the launch of the special action, the city has accepted 39 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 63%. Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 62%.

After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos has been basically contained, and the "one-day tour" market order has shown a steady and good trend.
According to the information, the city has continuously strengthen the force of illegal "one-day tour rectification in recent years.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints of "one-day tour", a year-on-year decrease of 79% and 44% respectively. Though the crack down actions are contentiously implemented, the illegal "one-day tours" are still recurrent, forming the intertwined profit chains among the "six unlicensed" chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website.
Specifically, "unlicensed ticket provider" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, "unlicensed website" is the illegal website providing fake tourism information, "unlicensed travel agency" engaged in illegal "one-day tour" or an institution without business qualification of travel agencies, "unlicensed tour guide" is the tour guide without tourist certificate or practice illegally and employed by the "unlicensed travel agency", "unlicensed car" is the vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by "unlicensed tour guide" or the vehicle with tourist transportation qualification used for providing passenger service to illegal "one-day tour", and last, the "unlicensed tour guide" will bring the tourists to the specified travel shopping store, that is "tourist trap".
In this special action, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and flexible inspection of illegal "one-day tour". Focus on the illegal "one-day tour" with high frequency and influential tourist route points, the relevant departments assigned daily secret investigation teams to make investigations with the tour groups secretly, and strict investigation and treatment will be imposed according to the law, if violations are found.
Among them, "unlicensed car" and "tourist trap" have become the two focuses of the serious crack downs in the special action.
According to reports, without "unlicensed cars", the illegal "one-day tour" can not be completed, "unlicensed cars" are easy to be found, remembered and investigated, they are also fixed value with a hinger single value.
Relevant departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along the key "one-day tour" routes, and use intelligence measures such as technology prevention and physical prevention to find and investigate "unlicensed cars" in time.
"Tourist trap" during traveling has become a key focus due to its small number and operation in locality.
In order to strengthen the shock and attack on illegal "one-day tour", all the functional departments will impose heavy and strict punishments according to law, once they have verified the violation of laws and regulations.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal "one-day tour", and discussed means and methods combining administrative punishment with conviction of imprisonment.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing "one-day tour" and increase the supply of formal "one-day tour" to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tour". The specific plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel itinerary information system of the tour group to ensure that each group is included in the electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a symbol of digital economy, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years
As the permanent site of the World Internet Conference, the way that Wuzhen undertakes the dividend of the summit attracts much attention.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Wuzhen has obvious changes over the past five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and Internet all over the town. By the third quarter of this year, there have been more than 500 enterprises.
This is a miniature of the development of digital economy in Wuzhen.
The Internet Conference enables local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the wave of digitization from zero distance. Enterprises have a strong desire to make transformation and upgrade. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investment and research and development in the aspects of machine substitution, intelligent management, etc.
Jiang Wei, the Party secretary of Wuzhen, says that the town will build a new economic empowered center in the future.
The development of digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen has launched a 5G pilot project based on full coverage of 4G communication networks and free WiFi.
Meanwhile, Tongxiang city, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in China to build a special channel for international Internet data, has become a hot spot for the development of Internet industry.

After aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation is 98% in China, which has reached the level of developed countries.
ECNS, Shanghai, September 30 (reported by Chen Jing and Luo Yanqian) -- Children's National Medical Center and Children's Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on September 30 that it had introduced the Canadian advanced method in the leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China".
The project result showed that after aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation was 98% in China, which had reached the level of developed countries. However, the survival rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and the survival rate of premature infants without complications still needed to be improved greatly.
During the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
Currently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly lower than the national average level and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has significantly improved the survival quality of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University told the reporter that it was of great significance for the improvement of premature infants' overall survival quality and population quality to pay attention to the reduction of premature infants' survival quality, reduce the complication rates, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate of premature infants. It was an important problem of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it was also a critical issue in this project.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has included tens of thousands of cases of premature infants of 33 weeks and less gestation in China and has contributed to 1/3 reduction of the mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and small birth weight through four years of unremitting efforts. At the same time, the severe complication rate of premature infants has been significantly reduced and the survival quality of premature infants has been greatly improved.
This project has established a set of complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methods, which are suitable for our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal care by setting up the national collaboration network of national quality improvement, introducing the concepts of collaborative quality improvement, and combing 25 cooperative hospitals in China.
Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It is reported that in the "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China", the pediatric hospitals has introduced the EPIQ methods into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order to solve the disturbing problem of neonatal infections in China NICU.
After more than 10 years of constant improvement, the survival rate of premature infants without complications in Canada has increased by about 1/3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis in premature infants in the world.
The EPIQ methods have been widely applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have been adopted by 6 other countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the research results show that after implementing the EPIQ intervention for two years, the infection rate of premature infants will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%.
In the future, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement these methods in the whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurrence rates of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns in China.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions in China.
According to Professor Cao Yun's introduction, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role as an important construction unit of Children's National Medical Center. This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and many other western provinces, with the goal of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is reported that Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It has been revealed that the coordination center's Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hospital of Fudan University will unite 63 hospitals across China to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement in 2019, with the goal of promoting the homogenization of neonatal treatment in China.
Wu Jinglei, the director of Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission, says that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia center. Its research, construction of the entire service system, service quality and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, in order to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Shiping: Build the "monument of heroes" in the heart - written on the fifth Memorial Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China, we ushered in the fifth Memorial Day. Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders came to the Tian'anmen Square to attend the ceremony for presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, please pay tribute to the heroes wherever you are.
The Memorial Day is not only for reviving, but also for awakening.
Look back the rich history, every martyr’s name represents a fresh life.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love and caring families.
However, for the belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe", and for the purpose to "spare the suffering of the next generation", they are willing to sacrifice everything.
"I would cry for China in each day of my life".
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signposts to guide the way forward.
"Where do you come from and where do you go?"; "What kind of man you want to be?"; It's not hard to have the answers if you understand the heroes.
In memory of heroes, the most important thing is to build a "monument of heroes" in the heart.
According to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, around 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, liberation of the people and prosperity of the country.
Due to various reasons, many martyrs don’t even leave their names.
Countless heroes and martyrs enrich ideals with blood, practice faith with life. To remember their names and inherit their spirit, is to protect the nation's root and soul.
This "monument of heroes" cannot be stained or damaged.
For some time, the historical nihilism, abused entertainment and other undercurrents emerge.
All sorts of actions that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange value judgments, and cause the public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.
Heroes and martyrs cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.
We cannot let actions that touch the bottom line drift. We must dare to show our sword and uphold the dignity of heroes with rule of law and justice.
On May 1, the law for the protection of heroes and martyrs came into force.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the verdict of some cases is to the satisfaction of the masses, which not only effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accordance with the law, but also releases the positive energy for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A nation with pursuits cannot live without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot live without pioneers.
It has become a common social consensus to recall the martyrs and call for heroes.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities of various kinds in China, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemetery every year.
The hearts of the people are the strongest footstones.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes and caring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of heroes merge into the national blood. The "monument of heroes" will stand firmly between sky and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy looked down upon EU demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan. But if Italy stuck to a too bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance.
The aim of Italian Eurosceptic government was that the budget deficit was equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that there was no debt reduction despite deficit reduction requirements.
Moscovici, the executive committee member of economic affairs of the European Commission, said on Friday, "We are not interested in the crisis between the European Commission and Italy," he responded cautiously since the proposals and sanctions of the European Commission might have little impact on Italy.
The officials and diplomats of the European Commission still hoped that market forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy officially submitted it to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit goal remained unchanged before the deadline in October, the European Commission might veto the Italian draft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission.
Dombrowski, the Vice-President of the European Commission said at a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention", which was referred to the EU fiscal provisions.
However, he did not mention how this would trigger a response of the EU.
Bidders may submit their applications for participation in this open tender before October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture regarded China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that Russian grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time in this agricultural year, setting a new record.
The bureau predicts that China may become the top ten Russian grain importers.

National wide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities experts walk into test fields, listen to the situation presentation from CAE Yu Shuxun academician team representative.
China News Service, Xinjiang, Xayar, September 30 (Geng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in the Xayar County of Xinjiang, the cotton planted in film-free cotton planting test base has a breathtaking growth. Compared with the film cotton next to it, it is not inferior in any respect. A cluster of snow-white cotton competes "blooming" and is full of branches.
From September 27 to 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system with "Chinese Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cotton field film residue to the ecological environment and raw cotton. And film-free cotton integrated technology’s research and demonstration have achieved significant progresses.
Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industrial technology system’s cotton system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A&F University.
"The comprehensive technology of the film-free cotton developed by us can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shuxun described, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China’s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulching film is about 30 million tons.
Among them, cotton mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use.
Use film-free cotton for production measurement, and the cotton output can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing amount of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate is low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by residual film seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mechanized harvesting area is about 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a large amount of broken film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and can not be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to implement the "Chinese Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, adding "advantages" to Xinjiang’s agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced, with the new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low temperature resistant, and high yield upland cotton "Chinese Cotton 619".
" ‘Chinese Cotton 619’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang. "
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, environmental protection and improved overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of mulching film.
"The support of cotton purchasing price will be conducive to future promotion. "
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of film-free cotton larger and stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

Beijing Renhe was at the critical stage of winning promotion to the top tier at that time, and BG finally lost 0-2 away to Beijing Renhe. Anichebe played from the first minute in the game.
BG Club made an official response to this Nigerian player's accusation yesterday.
It declared that after previously carrying out the internal investigation, the club found no match-fixing in the past games.
Anichebe joined Beijing BG in June, 2017. In December of that year, Anichebe refused to return to the team to take part in the winter training without any justified reason. Although the club repeatedly urged, he still refused to return.
At present, the dispute between the two parties has been submitted to the FIFA and the arbitration is in progress.
It also declared that the high-profile "match-fixing allegation" was actually a lie fabricated out of thin air by Anichebe so that he could cover up the fact that he had brazenly breached the contract and realize his personal improper economic purpose in the course of arbitration.
His sole aim of slandering the club and Chinese football was to obtain the illegitimate economic benefits.
The club would not accept any groundless accusations, defamation, vilification and slander made by any organization or individual due to its economic benefits and personal grudge.
Therefore, BG indicated that it would reserve the right to take all means to hold the relevant party accountable.

The railway departments reminded the passenger friends that the passengers, who had successfully booked their tickets via Internet and phone call but hadn't collected their tickets, should try their best to collect their tickets ahead of time since the passengers were concentratedly traveling during the holiday season; and that the passengers should carry their tickets and valid identity documents containing the same information with that on the tickets to take the train, and set aside sufficient time to collect tickets, go through security checks, accept ticket checking, and transfer to another train in order to avoid delaying their schedules.
Wang Yi, the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister made a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations on Friday, and said that currently, the China-U.S. relation came to a crossroad again. If both sides can actively treat each other with tolerance, expand and deepen the positive cooperation, and properly control differences and contradictions, they can open up a better prospect.
"The China-U.S. relation is our common asset which needs us to care about together. "
He said that it was expected that people of insight from all sectors of both countries took practical actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of the China-U.S. relation and jointly drove the China-U.S. relation to move forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also emphasized again that China was certain to take a development road different from that of the traditional great powers.
This road with Chinese characteristics determined that China would not or can not repeat the mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and determined that China would not become another United States, or challenge the United States, or even replace the United States.
Wang Yi made a speech with the topic of "Opportunity or challenge, partner or opponent" and said that currently, the profound crux of the problem is that some American friends believed that China would also make a mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
"This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. "
He said that this self-imagined suspicion was spreading, and had amplified the existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that the road China was walking on was a road for peaceful development.
Chinese people have never had a gene for expansion.
It was believed that all countries can live in harmony, and make exchanges and mutual learning.
Regardless of past, present or future, China would never copy foreign models, or require other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win and the confrontation would be necessarily lose-lose.
The Chinese side was always committed to developing the long-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. relation and achieving no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper of "The Facts and China’s Position on China-US Trade Friction".
Fu Ziying, the Vice Minister of China's Ministry of Commerce, said at the conference that China was willing to strive to promote the bilateral trade to develop in a more balanced direction and hoped that the United States would also show a positive attitude.
ECNS, October 1 -- According to foreign media reports, Sulawesi, an Indonesian island, was hit by strong earthquake and tsunami on September 28, and many coastal cities were heavily damaged. The latest information showed that the death toll had rose to 1200.
According to the reports, the tsunami stroke Donggala in Palu twice since it was near the epicenter of the quake. After the "golden 72 hours" for rescue, the authority thought that the death toll would continue to rise.
On September 30, 2018 local time, the rescuers were carrying an earthquake survivor saved under the ruins of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.
An official from the disaster relief department said that the huge waves brought by tsunami were up to 6 meters high. The impacts of earthquake and tsunami had exceeded people's original estimation.
It was learned that hundreds of people were celebrating a festival on the beach when the earthquake and tsunami struck. Many people were swept away by huge waves and died.
An official said that the tsunami was moving towards the shore at 800 miles an hour, and a lot of buildings and infrastructures were destroyed.
He said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and the debris flow caused by the tsunami cut off a major highway in Palu.
In Sulawesi, a bridge across a coastal river fell down.
On September 30, 2018 local time, Joko, the President of Indonesia, visited Palu in Central Sulawesi after the earthquake.
The Indonesian President Joko visited the disaster areas on September 30, and said that the troops had been sent out to assist the rescue. He also called for the victims to be patient.
Joko pointed out that it was very hard to carry out the rescue activities because of insufficient heavy-duty machines and people.
He heard that many disaster areas were short of drinking water, food, fuel and other materials, and many stores were closed after the earthquake. Therefore, planes were sent out to airlift supplies.
He called for the victims to be patient, and asked them to stay in the original location to wait for rescue.
The rescuers in Palu said they heard cries for help from a inside buried hotel, but they could do nothing because they didn't have heavy-duty machines to remove the rubbles. Some rescuers had to save people with their bare hands.
Kalla, the Vice President of Indonesia, said that the electricity and communication in some places were cut off, so the information was blocked. The number of deaths in this earthquake and tsunami might finally rise up to several thousands.

"Where can we take a taxi?
We'd like to go to the Golden Bauhinia Square to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
In the morning of October 1, Mr and Mrs Song, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the first train of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link for National Day, accepted an interview of a reporter from China News at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and inquired such information.
In the morning of October 1, in order to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong SAR Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics of the Immigration Control Point, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon station of the high-speed railway have exceeded 300,000.
At the very time of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the West Kowloon boundary checkpoint predicts a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw at the arrival lobby around 7:00 a.m. on October 1 that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week, to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.
Mrs Song with light-footedness told the reporter that the National Day holiday was a rare long holiday in a year. It has always been her wish to come to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to watch the flag-raising ceremony. She felt very happy and excited to be able to accomplish this will on National Day.
But currently, the flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient. Thanks to the opening of the high-speed railway for the Hong Kong segment. Mr Song checked the train schedule and found that the first train could arrive at 7:03 a.m., and it was perfect timing for taking urban transportation means to the Golden Bauhinia Square.
He told the reporters, "the high-speed railway is very convenient, fast and on time! "
The 70 daily one-hour short-haul trains running between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Futian and West Kowloon greatly facilitated the residents in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to visit Hong Kong.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr Liu, who lived in Shenzhen, was preparing to join his Hong Kong friends at the top of a hill in Central.
Mr Liu said, "both the mainland and Hong Kong have holidays on National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves and see if we can complete walking the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Trail! "
He explained that they would not dare to make such a long trek without the convenience and sufficient time brought about by the high-speed railway.
Mrs Yang, who came from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son to come to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition by taking the high-speed railway. She proudly told the reporter that her son had been studying piano for three years, and it was very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She had previously come to Hong Kong by bus, but it was time-consuming and laborious. She was worried about affecting her son's condition. This time she came from Shenzhen by high-speed railway. The customs clearance was convenient and the time was reduced by half. She was more impressed by the trip in Hong Kong segment. She told the reporter, "it seems like taking the subway, which is very fast. I am not able to do take photos before arriving! "
At 6:44 a.m. on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train departed from Shenzhen North Railway Station and sped all the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong segment of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link. This was the first formally operated high-speed train in the Hong Kong segment.
The Hong Kong segment of the high-speed railway, which integrates the national 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes mainland tourists from different provinces far apart from each other.
Mr Gao, who took advantage of minor vacation to visit relatives in Hong Kong from Changsha, told the reporter that previously, the high-speed railway could only travel to Shenzhen North, and he needed to take the subway to pass through Hong Kong, and then take urban transportation means. It was troublesome and time-consuming to make transfers. Now, he can travel directly to the center of Kowloon and have lunch which was made by his children when getting home. He felt very happy.
He said that the "one port and two immigration inspection" customs clearance procedure were very convenient beyond imagination, and "passing both customs within 10 minutes. "
The West Kowloon Station, which is close to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian Province, prepared to spend the Golden Week with her friends traveling from Hong Kong to Philippines. Pushing her luggage out of the gate on time in West Kowloon, she told the reporter without hesitation, "I was afraid of not catching up with the plane, but I didn't think it would be so fast and that was more than enough! "
According to the subsidiary arrangement of the trade agreement published on Monday, the new U.S. -Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the President Trump's ability to implement the threat to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs.
If Trump imposes a so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a tax-exempt quota of 2.6 million passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks manufactured in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive a tax exemption quota of $108 billion each year for auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
These two quotas are far higher than the current production levels of the two countries, and provide their exports with growth space.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on Friday that after days of debates, the U.S. President Trump's government and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is enough to prompt the Mexican and American governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to urge these three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, said the time for submitting the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation departments of Mexico and the United States had been delayed because the Canadian and American governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".
Guajardo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will get a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement. "
Guajardo said that the officials at the same level in the U.S. and Canada had "special requests" to postpone to publish the text.
The spokesman of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the negotiations between the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Prime Minister's Office and the Office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions playing in a conservation center located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, but they were absolutely unique.
University of Pretoria announced: "They are the first lions in the history, which are born by artificial insemination -- the first pair of lions in the world. "
The scientists of the university were committing themselves to studying the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion. They were pretty healthy and quite normal.
After the intensive tests in 18 months, his team finally made this breakthrough.
Ganswindt said in a media interview: "We collected the sperms from a healthy male lion. "
Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in the female lion to reach a proper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it.
Ganswindt said: "Fortunately, the result turned out to be successful. "
He said that the researchers "tried many times, but to their surprise, it didn't take much effort".
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use this technology to save the endangered big cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature indicated that the lion had already become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left.
The African lion was listed as vulnerable by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "This animal will be in danger of extinction if we do nothing for them. "
He said that with this kind of new technology, it's not necessary for the lions to be fed. The sperms could be injected into the bodies of female lions, just like the approach adopting on the elephants in captivity in North America and Europe.
The exports of South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said that although the trade tension between China and the United States rose, the global demand for South Korean goods remained strong.
Indeed, the average daily exports of South Korea increased last month.
Moreover, the initial value data released earlier showed that the exports in first weeks of September during the long vacation had a double-digit increase.
The year-on-year drop of South Korean exports in September was the largest since July 2016, which was more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analysts of Reuters surveys.
The initial value released on Monday showed that the amount of exports in September was $50.6 billion, lower than $51.2 billion in August.
Although the China-US trade disputes with intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in September increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
Since the sales of oil products declined, Korean exports to America decreased by 11.8%.
Although the market worried that the so-called "supercycle" of chips might reach the peak, the overseas sales of Korean memory chips and oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.
"However, the influence of trade conflicts cannot be avoided, because Korean exports considerably depend on American and Chinese markets. "
The imports decreased by 2.1% to $40.8 billion, inferior to the increase of 3.1% estimated by the Reuters survey.
The initial value of trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $6.9 billion in August.
The Department of Industry said that thanks to America and the EU countries, the global manufacturing would maintain buoyant, which was a favorable factor for Korean exports.
The statement pointed out, "the increasing export price caused by the rise of the oil price will be beneficial to the exports in the second half of this year. "
"However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U.S. interest rates intensifies, which are both negative pressure on exports. "
The average exports of each working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, while the amount in August was $2.1 billion.
The Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so that there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
The Korean exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with that of the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again in September which was supported by domestic orders, since Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would probably cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea.
North Korea's "Rodong Shinmun" published a signatured review article on September 30 to criticize the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea while seeking to have a dialogue with North Korea. The article said that it was a "self-contradictory" action.
The article said that Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 14 that "the key to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was to impose the sanctions on North Korea" to emphasize that the United States would keep its position on implementing the UN resolution to impose sanctions.
In the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Singapore, the two sides promised to build a new North Korea-US relation, which complied with the two peoples' wishes of looking forward to peace and prosperity.
On one side, the United States increased the intensity of sanctions, but on the other side, it asked for the dialogue. Undoubtedly, its actions were self-contradictory.
According to the article, if it wanted to build a new North Korea-US relation, establish a permanently consolidated system of peace in the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it would put building trust in the first place, start from what can be done, and solve the problems by stages.
The article also said that the United States should understand that it wouldn't work to impose sanctions on North Korea.
The article said that even the "Severodvinsk" preceded the "Kazan" was admired by the U.S. military.
The National Interest quotes the view of US Navy as saying, "we will encounter a strong potential opponent. It is enough to see the "Severodvinsk" submarine only. "
Foggo, the current commander in chief of the U.S. navy in Europe, also highly praised the "Severodvinsk" submarine.
He said, "this submarine is impressive. Look at the development of Russian navy and how they utilize resources and it will be known that their main efforts on the fields of research and development are firstly to strenghten the submarine fleet. "
However, the National Interest still considers the United States maintains the advantage against Russia in this field.
Foggo said, "I believe that western countries still have asymmetrical advantages. "
Previously, it was informed that the Russian navy would equip the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
The multipurpose submarines of "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are all of "Fraxinus-M" improved type, with displacement of 13,800 tons, depth of 520 m, staffing of 64, submerged speed of 31 knots. All the submarines will carry mines, torpedoes and "Kalibr" and "Onyx" cruise missiles.

Ignore the Threat of America!
EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreement with Iran
The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.
However, the American allies did not seem to take the advice.
According to the US "New York Times", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil with EU.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or domestic currency.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is concluded, it will be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The US media said that in the one hour interview , Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies and effectively break the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s income.
"This can guarantee that we can sell oil and obtain benefits", Zarif believed. According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. "
However, she also predicted that before the US government carried out the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial intercourses with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran and made the Iranian currency dropped sharply.
Companies such as Airbus S.A.S. and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials said, the US government may "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions did not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil exports.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran President Rouhani believed that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "seduce" Iran’s breach of the agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US serial blast as not worthy of consideration. When asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the true purpose of the US. "

The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that the prevalence of malnutrition in our children and adolescents had reduced but the prevalence of overweight-obesity had significantly increased comparing to decades ago.
The expert pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease". The scientific fitness and rational diet should be vigorously promoted.
According to the "Core Information on Health Education of Chinese Adolescents and Interpretation (2018 version)" released by the National Health Commission recently, the key to maintain a healthy weight was the rational diet and scientific movement.
The overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction were harmful to health.
The health hazard behind the "chubby children" couldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm the adolescents' normal growth and development, have a negative impact on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in children.
And the adolescents' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which would increase the adolescents' risk of having chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that the overweight rate was 9.6% and the obesity rate was 6.4% among Chinese children and adolescents of 6-17 years old according to the Nutrition and Health Status Inspection of Chinese Residents in 2010-2012. The sum of these two rates was 16%.
Meanwhile, the characteristics of overweight-obesity among children and adolescents were that the overweight-obesity rate was higher in boys than in girls, and it was higher in cities than in villages. The overweight-obesity rate had significantly increased in recent decades.
How would the adolescents deal with the overweight-obesity?
Zhang Li, the deputy director of Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of General Administration of Sport of China, indicated that the primary causes of adolescent obesity at present were excessive caloric intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this kind of simple obesity, we should lay emphasis on scientific movement and reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease", and an integral part of it was to conduct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and increase the adolescents' self-protection awareness.
The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, such as height and weight, so that the problems of overweight and obesity could be discovered early and determined scientifically to take intervention measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that starvation therapy or semi-starvation therapy should be avoided to control and lose weight in addition to the active and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage. They should not take drugs blindly to lose weight.

China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (reported by Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min) -- The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation" (hereinafter referred to as "Scheduling Regulation") was officially enforced starting from October 1. After two years of navigation test, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially scheduled together with the navigation lock in a unified way.
On the first day of enforcing the new regulations, the navigation in Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order.
Three Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan of security check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out the security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security check.
The navigation authority arranged the first locking plan after the enforcement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1.
After the enforcement of new regulations, the plan of security check would be released once every day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be released once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam.
The "Classification Control" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dam would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and ship lift respectively. The short-term passenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to be in the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity ship.
This is also the official scheduling of ship lift and navigation lock after the two-year navigation test of ship lift.
It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang River and Three Gorges Reservoir Region to be ranked in the priority.
At the same time, the "navigation scheduling management waters" were adjusted from the 180-kilometer waters close to dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishou Yangtze River Bridge in the "Scheduling Regulation". And the "core waters", "water close to dam", "control waters" and "scheduling waters" were divided.
This action would help the ship choose the proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoiding excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" also put forward the measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling the declaration and delaying the time of passing dam for 24 hours.
After water storing of the Three Gorges, the navigation condition of the reservoir area was improved, accelerating the rapid development of shipping in Yangtze River.
According to data, the annual cargo throughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively.
During the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 million people have passed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, the deputy director of Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the "Scheduling Regulation" played an active role in promoting the management of crossing lock in an honest way, relieving the pressure of ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region, and improving the navigation capacity.

Signed and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council printed and distributed the "Decision of the State Council on Further Reducing the Categories in the Catalogue of Industrial Products Subject to Production License Administration and Simplifying the Approval Procedures".
The "Decision" proposed to further reduce the categories in the catalogue of industrial products subject to production license administration, cancel the production license administration for 14 industrial products, and delegate the administration authority for production licenses of 4 types of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people’s governments.
After this reform, the products that implement the industrial product production licenses administration will be reduced from last year’s 38 categories to the current 24 categories.
The "Decision" clearly simplifies the approval process for products in the catalogue.
First, the pre-certification product inspection organized by the issuing authority is changed to the product inspection conformity report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution when the enterprise applies.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of the provincial people’s government shall be subject to post-site inspection. After the enterprise submits the application and product inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ensure product quality and safety, the production license can be obtained after passing the formal examination, and then the on-site examination is accepted within the specified time.
Third, for enterprises produce different types of products in the production and operation catalogue, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license", when apply for a new license or apply for a license renewal, a license should be issued and examined.
The "Decision" requires that all regions and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
Increase the commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint means, implement the responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, and revoke the production license for false promises and non-compliance.
For the products that cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen the post supervision, and the products related to public health and safety, environmental protection, etc. can be converted into compulsory certification, list positive lists and publicize to the public, unify the certification standards and reasonably reduce and merge the certification and testing items, and the compulsory certification fees in principle should be borne by the financial institutions at all levels.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification and promote brand building and market expansion.
It is necessary to benchmark the international advanced standards and promote the quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain industrial product production license administration, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervise", dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, timely reduce catalogues, delegate approval authority or convert to certification administration.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday that the bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the banking system of Japan.
However, he said that due to the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plans and pay close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the effect of low interest rates on shrinking profit margins over the years, the banking system could be unstable in the event of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not too big at present, the Bank of Japan will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
The minutes released by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed that the policy committee of the Bank of Japan discussed the problem of rising costs of the long-term easing policy at the interest rate meeting in September.
The minutes showed that a member of the board said that if the economy continued to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in the aspect of policy in the future. "
The minutes showed that another member of the board said that due to the limits of policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the incentive policy.
Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks brought by the easing policy, and take into account the uncertainties centered on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism might affect the global demand.
"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase," he added.
"It is necessary to sustain the strong monetary easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
Although the disadvantages of radical incentive plans were increasing, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained the monetary policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict of the global trade war.
On June 1, 2018, in Cardiff, the United States, the corporate identity on Tesla electric cars.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO, Musk, had agreed to separately pay $20 million fines to the financial regulators, and Musk would resign as President of the company, but still held the post of CEO.
This settlement agreement would end two months of unrest in Tesla.
This settlement agreement on securities fraud charge released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Saturday would make investors relieved.
Investors were originally worried that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which was still losing money.
SEC prosecuted Musk for frauds on Thursday, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled the investors.
The tweet said that he was considering to privatize Tesla with $420 per share and had obtained financing.
SEC said that these tweets actually had no evidences and the volatility in market triggered by them had hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said that this agreement could strengthen Tesla, which had been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, the leader of assets management company of Boston Common, said that this settlement agreement should let Musk receive more monitoring, but had not taken any "destructive" measures to throw him out of Tesla.
This assets management company held shares of Panasonic, the battery manufacturer of Tesla.
According to this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint a independent president, two independent directors and a board committee to set out controls aiming at Musk’s external communications.
"This matter was resolved promptly according to the agreed conditions, which met the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charge on Thursday caused the market value of Tesla evaporate about $7 billion. The market value of this company was $45.2 billion, lower than $47.5 billion of General Motors.
SEC withdrew the requirement for throwing Musk out of the head position of the company.
Many investors said that this punishment would be catastrophic.
"I think it is the best possible result for all relevant staff," Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners said. Feinseth gave a "neutral" evaluation to Tesla and said that the punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment" to Musk.
"The fact that he still holds the position of CEO is very important to Tesla. "
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the charge of SEC in the settlement agreement, or immediately replied to the request for commenting.
The settlement agreement still needed to get approval of the court.
Beijing Morning Post (reported by Wang Ping) -- The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned from Beijing Construction Engineering Group a few days ago that the multi-colored ETFE jigsaw membrane structure would be adopted in the Performing Arts Plaza project of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing, which was one of the core building groups in the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing park. The 5440-meter membrane structure would show 6 colors, including dark red, dark green, orange, blue, red, and green, and it would appear in the shape of "a butterfly flying up high" under the tension created by steel strand draglines.
According to the introduction made by Liu Changbao, the project leader of Beijing No. 5 Construction Engineering Group, the building area of the Performing Arts Plaza project was 4500 square meters, and the total amount of installed steal was 1182 tons. The steel roof was supported by the cantilever steel truss with a 26-beam umbrella arrangement. It would appear in the shape of "a butterfly flying up high" under the tension created by steel strand draglines.
"Taking a bird's-eye view of the Performing Arts Plaza, the colorful roof seems like a butterfly dancing among the flowers. And the bright colors will not fade even weathered rain and snow over time".
The single-colored ETFE membrane structure has been widely applied in the Bird's Nest, the Water Cube, and other projects, but this is the first time to use the multi-colored ETFE jigsaw membrane structure across the country.
The reported learned that every inch of the membrane structure was very "precious" since there were only a few suppliers capable of producing the multi-colored membrane structure around the world.
Liu Changbao said that the dragline head structure with "double ears" would also be adopted innovatively to aviod the problems of overlapping or "fighting" in the position of dragline head. A special fixed widget would be used to ensure the "fighted" dragline heads are packed in the correct position.
The construction of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing park is in progress at present.
The project of the International Hall has completed all hoisting construction works of "flower umbrella".
According to the plan, the project will be ready for arranging the exhibitions at the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that "letting entrepreneurs unload their mental loads and march with light packs", which has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent course of the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innovation stories, the growth and expansion of entrepreneurs-group constantly push the Chinese economy to sail far.
For some time, some people in the society have published some remarks that negate and doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economic departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" and other misconceptions have caused some entrepreneurs’ doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprise have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies with good original intentions have the opposite effect, etc.
All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Under this context, it is particularly profound and practical to correct the cognition errors, let the entrepreneurs’ unload the mental load, let them develop wholeheartedly, make the government promote development devotedly and concern market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium once again emphasized the important assertion of the "Three no-changes": "There is no change in the role and function of non-public sector in our economic and social development"!
In recent years, from deepening the promotion of streamline administration and delegate more power to lower-level governments, establishing a power list system, and creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition and shaping the atmosphere of respecting entrepreneurs in the whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented emphasis on entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees.
The symposium clearly stated the six aspects’ policy measures to vigorously support the development and expansion of private enterprises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "march with light packs" of private enterprises.
These actions have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and have given more expectations to the community.
The fog has been set aside, and the policy has been set. And the key aspect lies in implementation.
We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help achieve China’s economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, and feel respected in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy has stepped into a process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions and providing more spaces and stages for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will greet better development prospects and opportunities and move toward a broader stage.

It was known that the preparation time of documents referred to the preparation time of various types of documents required for import and export before declaration, which was a major factor that affected the overall clearance time. In order to compress the clearance time and reduce the clearance costs, the documents must be reduced.
Previously, there were 86 types of supervision documents in the import and export process which required customs examination, involving 19 departments.

Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years, which may be related to the increase of empty-nest youth - China News
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years; analysis: it is related to the increase of empty-nest youth
According to the report on Day 5 of Yonhap, last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 times compared with that of four years ago, in 2013.
The analysis suggests that this growth is related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
This data is published by the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp (aT) on Day 5.
Last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China was 100,339 US dollars and the weight was 21,859 kg, which surged by 2094% and 3668.8 % respectively compared with that in 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increasing sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China are related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
By the end of this year, the number of one-person households in China have exceeded 200 million, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020. Local food enterprises are also aiming at the “eating-alone people" and launching various convenience food.
Moreover, the analysis also indicates that bird flu is the biggest factor which prevents ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.
aT says that bird flu outbroke in South Korea from November 2016 to April of last year. Relevant departments comprehensively ban the export of ginseng chicken soup to China which leads to sharp reduction of export sales.
In 2016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 US dollars. Due to bird flu, the export sales of last year plummeted to 100,000 US dollars.

A gateway flag-raising ceremony is held in Hekou port on China-Vietnam boarder to celebrate the National Day.
"I didn't expect to see such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the frontier. It is more amazing to watch the flag-raising here than in the mainland. "
In the morning of October 1, Mr Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit Hekou port in Yunnan on China-Vietnam boarder, watched the gateway flag-raising ceremony together with more than 500 army officers and soldiers, local people, and Chinese and foreign tourists to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Hekou port is the biggest port on China-Vietnam boarder in Yunnan. It is located in Hekou county in Honghe Prefecture in Yunnan Province with just a river away from Lao Cai City in Vietnam. It is a first-class national port.
With the continuous enhancement of "One Belt and One Road" construction in China, as one of the most convenient passage connecting China and Southeast Asia, Hekou port has a steady growth of departure and entry flow.
At 7:30 in the early morning of the same day, a ray of sunshine just showed in the sky. The local people and Chinese and foreign tourists had gathered in the restricted areas in Hekou port very early to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony started on time. The members of gateway honor guard of Hekou Frontier Inspection Station were in high spirits and walked with vigorous steps escorting the national flag to the flag tower.
After the flag-raising command made by the commander, the flag raiser waved his arm hard to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag stretched out like an "eagle stretching its wings", and rose slowly with the melody of the majestic and impassioned national anthem.
"It not only shows China's image, but also inspires the patriotism among people of all nationalities in border areas to held a flag-raising ceremony on every New Year's day, Spring Festival, National Day, and other time nodes of great significance. "
A member of the honor guard taking part in this flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the gateway honor guard taking charge of flag-raising ceremony in Hekou port is made up of more than 40 officials and soldiers coming from various positions of Hekou Frontier Inspection Station. From a 3-member flag-raising team to a large-scale honor guard, it has developed in more than 60 years. Since its establishment, it has performed more than 70 national-level tasks in foreign affairs as the honor guard.
The newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
On 30th, the relevant principals from the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China and State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The principals expressed that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The portion of the overseas payment does not need to pay personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce also issued notices to expand the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for overseas investors with distribution of profit investment.
For the profit distributed by overseas investors from domestic enterprises in China used for the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for domestic direct investment, the foreign investment encouraged projects should be extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information for the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in related the "irreversible" denuclearisation determination as told by the DPRK and said that US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit the DPRK in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the ice and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings. The general trend of the easing of the peninsula has been continued, and the dialogue’s principle of solving the peninsula issue has also been adhered to.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to realizing peace on the peninsula is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties in a proper and balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other side and stressing own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who is first and who is second" is still strong.
At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have not changed.
Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle of "responding to action by action". He pointed out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearization."
Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressuring is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take a big move toward denuclearization.
Review the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the international community’s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A message from Ji County People's Government in Linfen City in Shanxi Province on October 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River located in this county would maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, so it didn't meet the requirements to be open to the public.
In order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be temporarily closed during the National Day holiday.
Hukou Falls of Yellow River is the second biggest fall in China, and the biggest yellow fall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here at great speed, and the stone walls on both sides are rising steeply. The river mouth becomes narrow like the spout of kettle, forming the situation that "a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like to be collected into a kettle".
The reporter learned that the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to October. Due to high levels of water, the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had been closed one after another since July 12, 2018. Therefore, according to the accumulative calculation, Hukou scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, the chief engineer of Hukou Scenic Areas Management Committee, said to the media that it was the longest time for the Yellow River to keep high levels of water during the past 20 years. "It hasn't been closed for such a long time. We closed it for four days in the flood season in 2017. However, it has been closed for nearly a month. "
It was learned that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged extra staff and vehicle maintenance in advance in order to be well-prepared for the "National Day" golden week, and even the temporary staff had been hired.
According to the "Notice on Being Well-prepared for the Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day Holiday" issued in the "Office Telegram of Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were required to be well-prepared for the flood control in the Yellow River during the National Day holiday.
Currently, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is relatively large. The upstream river flow is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the midstream river flow is maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.
The health center and the health station specially provide influenza vaccination services during the National Day Holidays
The health station has ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 four-strain flu vaccine this year and at this stage, free vaccination is preferentially provided for high-risk people. To facilitate the citizens to vaccinate with flu vaccine during the holiday, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau will specially provide vaccination services from 9 am to 1 pm during the National Day Holidays ( October 1 through 2).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended their influenza vaccination service time to 8 pm from Monday to Friday. By 4 pm on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which was more than that of the same period last year for 3,714 people.
Free vaccination objects include the following Macao residents: people under the age of 6 months to 18 years, people at the age of 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases (including fat people, namely, the persons whose body mass index (BMI) is 30 or more), staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, all the health workers and the Macao residents who work in the casino.
Meanwhile, for the other people who are considered to be necessary to vaccinate by the Health Bureau, including the personnel of the public sectors, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant authorities to obtain the list and then the health centers will arrange them for vaccination.
To facilitate the vaccinees and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to Macao middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries from October to December to perform collective influenza vaccination to the children, students, teachers and staff; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange staff to go to the institutions of the elderly and disabled, public sectors or other institutions with a large number of people to perform collective influenza vaccination.
Students and children who fail to participate in the collective vaccination can take Macao resident identity cards, user cards of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination cards (if any), student identity cards, employee identity cards or occupational certificates to the vaccination station of the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or health centers from December 3, 2018.
The Health Bureau reminds residents that people who vaccinated with the 2017-2018 flu vaccine during September 2017 and August 2018 still need to vaccinate with the new seasonal flu vaccine from September 2018, since the flu antigen composition of 2018-2019 flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere has been updated , which is targeted at the seasonal influenza in winter of 2018-2019 and summer of 2019 in the Northern Hemisphere.
The peak of influenza in Macao usually occurs from January till March every year, later than that of the temperate regions (such as Northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau urges the elderly, children, pregnant women, fat people and chronic patients who are at high risk of complications after being infected with influenza and people who are in regular contact with high-risk people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

Report of Reuters on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year for that season in September, as raw material costs rose and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on enterprises.
This survey almost didn’t show that the escalating global trade frictions shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stuck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten the business capital expenditure.
The active capital expenditure is a highlight of Japanese economy.
This survey raised questions about the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signs that enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers.
"With concerns raised by the global trade war, as exports slowed down and factory production weakened, the confidence of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research Institute Co., Ltd..
"Confident is still at a high level. And since corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 21 for three months ago to positive 19 in September, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The median market forecast is positive 22.
The judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 24 researched in June to positive 22 in September, worsening for the first time for eight quarters.
The survey of Reuters was positive 22.
The survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing was expected to remain stable in December.
Investors were indifferent to the decline of the judgment index for the boom of Tankan enterprises. The Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high spot on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.
The capital expenditure was robust.
Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tankan highlighted the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of population.
The Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan showed that the capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would increase by 13.4% for the fiscal year ended in March 2019.
It was 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble era.
He said, "considering that small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. "
The Tankan survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced. The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high spot. It was an encouraging sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, which was the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March shrink in the second quarter.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese economy which depended on exports.
In dollar terms, import and export of services increase by 16.4%.
The news release of the website of the Ministry of Commerce citing the head of the Department of Trade in Services and Commercial Services said that the total import and export volume of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, and the growth rate was faster than that of the whole.

Subsequently, the OPEC Production Cut Conference explicitly refused to increase production, giving market confidence to believe that the oil prices will move up steadily. "
Zhuochuang Information refined oil product analyst Zang Wengang said.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Center, the Canton Fair showed that the situation of China's foreign trade was still complex and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the same level as last year.
However, in consideration of the rising costs of domestic raw materials, labor force and other comprehensive factors, as well as the external environment of the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year was not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same period of last year.
The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.
The amount of export transactions was 206.494 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
From the perspective of the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions with traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.

Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers’ participation situation and the export transaction data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade development would still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform and the "six stability" policies and measures recently introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for the development of China’s foreign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had made new progress, all of which were the important foundation and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that the imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency. " Xu Bing said.
The China’s General Administration of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increased by 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February.
In despite of the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation. Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the United States and the depreciation of RMB exchange rate, might be the main supporting factors, and also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the industrial chain can not be neglected. Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holdings and stood the cautious ground in September, since the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, the asset allocation in North America rose to the highest level since June 2017, while positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
The average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with the survey of last month.
The most obvious change was that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest proportion since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so that it's better to get prepared to enter when the market falls after a rise. "
However, the fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially American stocks, even though the price of American stocks were considered to be on the high side.
Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition with the theme of import, has officially opened in much anticipation.
An exhibition is like a "window" which can let the world know a city and a country better.
Through the "window" of CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of the "window" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China which is "restarting from reform and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.
"For a country, opening-up is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. There will be pain, but there will be new life. "
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reveals an important reason "why China can do it".
Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vast sea of the world market. Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, it always faces all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves its competitiveness.
So to speak, China has fully demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Central Committee with the core of Comrade Xi Jinping with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will that "China's opening door won't close, but would open wider and wider".
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it is difficult to apply for a stand", which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider range of fields and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroad.
Some countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the international society about the prospects for free trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy.
Under such era background, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guard to free trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and share its future.
It is fast to go alone but it is further to go in crowds.
By embracing the world with an open mind, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other countries and regions.
In recent years, by advocating and promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing the Silk Road fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, a solid export market, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of various countries to get a ride on the "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of China's development.
CIIE is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive features, taking a new step into the Chinese market.
Apart from companies of various countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building the platform of "selecting the best and importing the best", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider and wider, the goods flow is smooth and materials are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. It has the future in mind, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
Only when the world is doing well can China do well; when China is good, the world is better.
We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an "opening-up China" moving to a higher level and the world build a community of human destiny.
Foreign media report that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
It is reported by foreign media that a Canadian source said in the evening of September 30 at local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It is revealed that the content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
On Day 27 of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement while the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the deadline set by the American side of August 31 and extended the negotiation deadline to September 30.
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, and "the focus is on substance rather than timetables. We will continue to consult in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in line with the national interests of Canada. "
Over 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women’s needs.
According to the Overseas Chinese News Network of South America, data released by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country’s population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of the women voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the National Congress of Brazil is only 10%.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women’s participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their reserved rights.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, the existence of this phenomenon is because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values.
"Politics should be civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups advocated by citizens. But the politics of Brazil belong to a monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented. "
A previous study by the Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians elected by the election can represent their rights, and 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. 93% of women disagree with the current government policy.
"We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in National Congress, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there has been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political field in Brazil. " Natalia Mori said.
Although there is the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

[Abstract] Upon completion, this vessel will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of China's State Oceanic Administration for use. Chen Zhi, the director of the Observation Division of Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of China's Ministry of Natural Resources, said it would be of great significance to develop China's offshore ocean observation system and promote global ocean observation after the vessel came into use.
On September 29, the first 3000-ton large-scale buoy vessel "Xiangyanghong 22" was launched in Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co.,Ltd.
Upon completion of this vessel, it will break the current equipment bottleneck of support work, such as the launching, retrieval and repair of large-scale buoys and subsurface buoys in China.
The "Xiangyanghong 22" vessel is mainly used for regular inspection and maintenance, regular launching and retrieval of buoys and subsurface buoys, emergency deployment, recovery and emergency launching, retrieval, repair and other support work of buoys and subsurface buoys. The vessel also has the ability to carry out comprehensive marine survey tasks such as cross-sectional survey.

ECNS, Qingdao, October 1 -- Affected by Typhoon Trami, the first race day of 2018 Qingdao "Mazarin" Cup powered by Extreme Sailing Series was postponed from September 30 to October 1, and the pre-game meeting was held before the race in Olympic Sailing Center in Qingdao. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions attended at the meeting.
Affected by Typhoon Trami, the strong winds constantly blew in the harbor basin and the maximum wind speed even reached 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on September 30. The wind speed was still not reduced, so the Race Director Anne Mallédant announced to cancel the race of the first day and postpone the race to the afternoon on October 1.
"The strong winds from the shore never seem to stop, and the state of the sea is so severe. "
Mallédant explained: "No one knows the time when the gust will blow to the racing boats as well as the scale of wind force.
Since the boat-sailing field is near the city, so far as it goes, the wisest choice is to cancel the race. "
The sailors still felt a little disappointed for everything was ready.
"The racing boats are ready, and we are in excellent condition. "
The helmsman of Qingdao Team Max Richardson said frankly: "But I know it is a right choice to change the race date. And I hope the wind will die down today, so that we can do some good. "
Micah Wilkinson, the "Hope Star" of New Zealand Team for 2020 Tokyo Olympiad, said: "Losing a day's time makes the race more interesting.
Because the race content will be increased today, and there will be only two days left for the race.
All of us will play hard. "
Though the sea wind blew violently, the helmsman of French ABM Team Pierre-Yves Durand told his warm memories with Qingdao at the pre-game meeting that he was accidentally injured in the Extreme Sailing Series 5 years ago, resulting in the muscular rupture, and fortunately, the local race medical team helped him deal with it so that he could stand here to take part in the race after 5 years.
It was learned that the Extreme Sailing Series started from 2007, and it was an ISAF game equivalent to the Volvo Ocean Race, the America's Cup and the World Match Racing Tour.
The hydrofoil catamaran of "FlyingPhantom" would be used in this race in Qingdao.
It is the 8th year of having this race in Qingdao, the "City of Sails". And it is the last race of this Series.
Although the turbulence in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it was better than that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.
According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on the legislative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index. By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the U.S. itself.
"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment. If the trade war only has unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. "
He also pointed out that "if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. "
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses was HK$16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK$9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund was mainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Kong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.
"The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a net external asset value of US$1.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan. It is enough to cope with the financial downturns or reversal. "
The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest margin with US dollars expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21. The markets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars. And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of the US dollar. Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract more hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared with that of the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates were lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and prepared to cope with market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further. The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month daily interest rates on private loan hit the bottom within five months, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot rate of Hong Kong dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of the time.
During that time, due to factors of partial share offer gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing that the exchange guarantee for the weak side was triggered for the first time in April, and for many times in May and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linked exchange rate system, in order to maintain the stability of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought around HK$52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side from May to August.
Does foreigners can benefit from the new Individual Income Tax Law?
On 30th, the relevant person in charge from Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation answered the reporters that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some reporters asked that the newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
"May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in implementing this new law?"
The principals responded that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The principals said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The confinement center without "threshold": quality certification would promote the quality.
As the "two-child economic" develops and the maternal and child market thrives, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tier cities.
The popular confinement service centers, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, they were in an awkward situation, because this kind of institution had no threshold at all, and there was still the There is still a blank zone in regulation.
Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal and child care services.
A common confinement center provided the services of newborn care, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, etc.
The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns with the careful nursing services, such as bathing and touching.
In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would provide the wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and other nursing items to help the new mother restore her graceful figure.
A new mother there told the reporter that she had booked this confinement service center 8 months in advance.
The service items of confinement service center would directly impact the parturient's comfort and body recovery during the confinement. Some small confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the confinement, but there were many problems and hidden troubles, including the irregular sterilization and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.
The responsible person of this confinement center said that they were the only one five-star confinement center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B service provider.
"Some customers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit the customers. It is important for the long-term development of enterprises. " he said.
Pan Lifen, the deputy director of the Attestation Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service certification was a new kind of certification system, which was based on the customers' perception and focused on the organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It was an important part of the national quality infrastructure, and had a positive effects on increasing the proportion of quality services and enhancing China's international service competitiveness.
After more than 10 years of development since 2004, the service certification project in our country had gone through a process of developing from scratch. A series of influential service certification had appeared, including the financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, after-sales service certification, electronic commerce service certification, and health care service certification.
According to the statistics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are more than 130 service certification institutions with over 2000 service certification staff and nearly 8000 valid authentication certificates at present in our country.
Pan Lifen said that it was necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually extend the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and boost the supply-side reform and quality enhancement in the service industry.
Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive months after peaking. Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed time to observe whether the property market had entered downturns. If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price fell, the first to be affected would be those who bought properties at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple senior leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the property market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures can be made in succession at an appropriate time.
"However, since data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's still too early to ease, and it needs more time to see whether the property market is entering downturns. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of the number of mortgages, and that the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.
As Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate rise cycle, the house price index of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in August and September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy. In the second quarter this year, the percentage of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 66%, which was higher than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newly approved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respectively, with obvious improvement compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chen Delin said that high shock resistance didn’t mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn’t be suffered damage of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, and those who bought properties at peak times would be the first to be affected.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened the lending of the bank to the mortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mortgage insurance, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on.
Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, the vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lower proportion.
At the peak time of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with proportion of 22% in those who took mortgage.

ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei & Liu Shumeng) -- It was the first day of the National Day "Golden Week" in the mainland on October 1. And it was also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong. Many mainland residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping across the border, while many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen. The passenger volume of Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", and the ports in Luohu and Shenzhen Bay had newly opened 22 automated gateways. This would improve the clearance efficiency in ports and facilitate the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly.
According to the data provided by Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 4290000 people and over 168000 vehicles had been transported across the boarder by 16:00 that afternoon. The ports had always been busy and orderly with a good order of entry and exit.
It was learned that there were an increasing number of passengers taking advantage of the National Day holiday to visit the countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to go shopping affected by many positive factors, such as there were more countries providing the visa-free policy for the Chinese citizens.
The passenger (car) flow peak in the exit direction in the ports in Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of October 1. The passenger flow peak in Luohu port lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the passenger (car) flow peak in Shenzhen Bay port lasted from 6:30 am to the noon at 13:00.
According to the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flow peak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection followed the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration to start the service mode of passenger (car) flow peak period, arrange the policemen to work overtime to support those working in the front-line on duty, open enough passages for inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the queueing time of Chinese citizen's exit and entry would not exceed 30 minutes while taking into account of the foreigner's clearance efficiency; the order maintenance in the crowded was enhanced, and the customs clearance was ensured to be safe and orderly.
Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection also reminded the travelers across the boarder to pay attention to the expiry dates of their certificates, visas, and endorsements before their trips, make the travel arrangement in a reasonable way, try to avoid the passenger flow peak period and choose a right time and a right port to travel.
The passengers headed for Hong Kong via Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link must take their valid exit & entry documents, visas and endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket could be used as a proof of payment only, but not the exit and entry certificate. Anyone, who couldn't go to Hong Kong across the boarder due to the reasons such as the documents and procedures were not satisfiable, should follow the guide of the policeman on duty in the Frontier Inspection, and go to the designated site to wait for the staff of MTR corporation to guide them to go through the procedures of returning the mainland by train.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and stubborn disease involving multiple organs of the body. It used to be considered as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and for all.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University People’s Hospital, together with their teams discovered the existence of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and member of Peking University People’s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study. It was found that patients with immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the powerful combination between two teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. "
This is not shield mistakes, but acting by law.
Lawyers took an axe to the court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also caused a great disturbance in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the behaviors of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law.
According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal of the event stems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and same model as the defendant’s weapon, but it is not put the first edge. It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there is no threatening acts or the subject intention of "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, there are four very important details to be concerned. First, the local court has twice held the court and only showed a photo of the axe. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe. Second, the axe is purchased one hour before the court open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s consent, but it is not able to contact the judge objectively. Third, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper manner. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately apologized to the court.
Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" have nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties.
And this decision can withstand the test of facts and laws.
As taking the axe as the controlled knife to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also understandable.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen of the People’s Courts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court.
Since the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set examples, and there have been few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of security checks.
In such a very rare case happened in Quanzhou, as long as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law and safeguard the legitimate rights.
In the past, individual Lawyers Association organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process and results, and it sets an example for more lawyers association to perform their duties correctly.
Which tax benefits will affect our money bag from October 1?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reported by Sang Tong) -- The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from January 1, 2019. In order to have the broad masses of the people enjoy the benefits of tax reduction as soon as possible, the tax will firstly be deducted from taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the minimum threshold of 5000 yuan per month from October 1, 2019, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied.
With the implementation of new policy, which benefits will really affect the people's money bag?
The first benefit: the income tax will be reduced significantly in the job salaries.
The taxpayer receiving the job salaries after October 1 can have the basic deduction of fees deducted based on the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied. Most of the taxpayers will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction.
According to the tax reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the people whose monthly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan after deducting the "three insurances and one fund", the taxable amounts after the tax reform will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salaries that should be paid by the units in October but have been paid at the end of September according to laws.
For this purpose, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promoted and used by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.
The second benefit: the gaps between grades of low tax rates will be obviously widened.
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.
This time, seven grades of tax rates of job salaries are the same as before without any changes, but the gaps between grades of tax rates are obviously changed. The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but the gaps between three grades of high tax rates in 30%, 35% and 45% are the same as before.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the grades of tax rates for income from production and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rate in 35% has been increased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 million yuan.
This means that the individual businesses and personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit from this tax reform.
"From the perspective of measurement and calculation of personal tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of taxpayers will fully experience the benefits of the personal income tax reform, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction. "
Lan Min, the head of Personal Income Tax Division of Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
The third benefit: the tax service will become more convenient and optimized.
Shanghai tax departments have carried out a series of comprehensive activities of tax propaganda since the announcement of the new personal income tax law.
On the one hand, they provided the policy guidance on "one-to-one & point-to-point" for the important tax sources and important enterprises.
Pudong New Area Tax Bureau has visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. and other large enterprises successively. These enterprises have a large number of employees and a large amount of works in withholding and remitting tax, so the tax department actively provided coaching and answered questions; Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited some large labor service enterprises, including CIIC Financial Consulting Ltd. and CIIC Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Ltd. within the district. It collected their concerned problems, responded to their appeals, and resolved their difficulties in a timely way.
On the other hand, they implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tax policy promotion for the citizen taxpayers.
They used Shanhai Tax official website, WeChat official account, MicroBlog and other resources to post the hot topics and ensured that the policy announcements were in place.
At the same time, Shanghai Tax WeChat official account has put the 12366 Intelligent Consulting Platform since September 28. It would carry out the "targeted" integrated intelligent services of personal income tax reform via the "Human+Intelligence" tax service consultation.

The result of the Election of Okinawa Governor, which was conducted ahead of schedule because the former governor Onaga Takeshi had died of illness, was announced on October 1 local time. Denny Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocating the US military base in Japan, was elected successfully.
This election was voted on September 30. The final result showed that Tamaki had 396632 votes, which was the most votes made in the history of the Election of Okinawa Governor. He had over 80000 more votes than his major opponent Atsushi Sakima.
A total of 4 candidates participated in this election, and the voting rate was 63.24%, which was 0.89% lower than that of the Election of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during his lifetime, and he would carry out Takeshi's behests to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base to the Japanese government and the American government.
The Futenma base is located in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized all the time. The Japanese government and the American government have agreed to relocate it to Henoko in Nago, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose this action and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
For the relocation plan strongly opposed by Okinawa people and the request to cancel the permit for land reclamation along the coast of Henoko, Tamaki said that he didn't stand on the opposite and divisive ground against the central government at the beginning. He hoped that both sides could fully exchange views, show the intention to solve the problems through negotiation.
Japanese President Shinzo Abe also told the media in the morning of October 1 that he would seriously accept this result and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said in the press conference on October 1 that the government's policy of relocating the US base as soon as possible had not been changed at all.
And he also expressed his intention to talk with Tamaki.
Tamaki will officially take up his duties as the governor of Okinawa.
Since the mid-2000s, with China’s increasing needs for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
This transition reaches the peak this year. He has grown 1,600 acres of soybeans in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds that of corn this year, which is for the first time in 35 years.
The reason why the farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by President Trump against China.
China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported from America, but because of the trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas plans to grow more wheats next year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomas said that the soybean price "brings us a heavy blow".
He said that the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for covering costs was $8.50.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is expected to hit a high record.
At such a vulnerable time, they are hit by the trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported from America in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated area next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated area of soybeans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cultivated area of soybeans would decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa also predicted that the cultivated area of wheats in America would increase by 4%.
The cultivated area of soybeans increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that of 10 years ago.
The cultivated area of corns has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008. The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million acres this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total cultivated area of the president of Illinois Corn Growers Association Aron Carlson’s family is 3,600 acres. He uses nearly half of the land to grow soybeans, but he plans to make reduction in the future.
He said that the cultivated area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this state is the largest soybean cultivation state in America.
The yields per acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a whole.
If farmers switch production to corns, the cost may increase. But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and other enterprises may benefit from it.
Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that switching production to corns would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer also predicts to benefit from farmers switching production to corns.

Xinhua International Commentary: Defend Multilateralism, China Fully Honor Its Commitments.
Under the circumstance of unilateralism adverse current surging, international rules and multilateral order have been impacted.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered into a critical period.
As a responsible great power, China has taken the idea of following the general tendency and corresponding with major principles and the action with solid and power to maintain multilateralism with the international community and promote multilateralism going ahead continuously.
Facing the new situations and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, State Councilor and Foreign Minister, stated at the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly that multilateralism in the new era should pursue the goal of win-win cooperation, act upon rules and order, uphold fairness and justice, and act to deliver real results.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation of making the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as the complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with shared future for mankind.
China’s thought and voice reflect the mainstream of the international community.
As the President of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly Espinosa said, under the current situation, "the United Nations needs to develop and expand multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system more than ever".
Lagarde, President of International Monetary Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, as the changes of global economy and political power balance, some newly-developing markets and developing countries have emerged in groups, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, and providing new development impetus for the multilateralism that has suffered from the headwinds.
Thinking in this dimension,building a big family but not making up small circles, adhering to discussion and collaboration but not winner-take-all and other the multilateralism ideas advocated by China follow the trend of the times, they are the inevitable choices to cope with global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common pursuit of the majority countries around the world.
Advanced idea with more solid action.
China’s "One Belt One Road" has become the largest international cooperation platform.
"One Belt One Road", Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, "16+1 Cooperation" and other international and regional cooperation initiatives launched by China promote international cooperation, improve existing international systems and order, and bring innovation vitality to multilateral cooperation and make contribution to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As the defender of the international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China’s actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral stage of the United Nations.
Mediate heated-discussion international points, address climate changes, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help the poor, and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As United Nations Secretary-General, Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.

The fifth "Month of vocalization for the disabled" comes; focus on the issue of sex education for disabled teenagers - China News
In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese teenagers has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled teenagers is still arduous.
Recently, the seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled was held in Beijing.
It is an major issue about how to carry out sex education for disabled children and young people in this seminar.
"The report of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of Chinese disabled children and young people" released at the meeting reveals that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and teenagers, what the society focuses on is the attention of "sexual protection".
This seminar aims at promoting the comprehensive sex education for disabled children and teenagers in China from three aspects of family support, school education and institution services, providing support to the disabled children and teenagers from the source, thus letting them enjoy the right of love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public understanding of disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough for a long time.
Being influenced by the traditional concept and other factors, the comprehensive sex education for the disabled, especially for the disabled children and teenagers in China, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of the UNESCO and public-spirited people, the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in China have made gratifying progress.
"The report" shows that the children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationship than the ordinary people, but they have generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
"The seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled" is held by the Shanghai Youren Public Welfare Foundation and supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the Beijing Representative Office of the International League for Disabled Persons (France) and the UNFPA Representative Office in China. Its purpose is to explore the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in the context of grand strategy of healthy China, and promote the interested parties of policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations and parents’ representatives in the field of special education and integrated education to understand the international policy on comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of disabled children and young people; the practices, strategies, challenges and resources of sex education for disabled children and young people in China are widely exchanged, and the way of comprehensive sex education for disabled children and young people in the future is discussed and a blueprint is set up to form a support network.
Report of the Reuters on September 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of China released its predetermined short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday and showed as of the end of August this year, its short positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies remained zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no long position in that month.
Previous data from the People's Bank Of China showed that as of the end of August last year, the it had a total short position of $6.044 billion in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the foreign exchange forwards short position of the People's Bank Of China remained zero.
People's Bank Of China released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, its long positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies was US$2.438 billion and short positions was US$28.9 billion.
The data in September released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short position increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
People's Bank Of China has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies vs local currencies mainly reflected the forward operations of foreign exchange carried out by the People's Bank Of China with commercial banks with the purpose of meeting the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities. It would continue to provide forward hedging products according to the principle of actual demand, and the forward operations of the People's Bank Of China would have minor impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, student Qiao, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi.
An elder uncle on the train bought a ticket without seat, but he took up her seat, and said: "you can take photos, whatever".
During the two hours of driving, the train conductor advised him for an hour, however it still had no results.
In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not stand up and pulled up the elder uncle.
From the public opinion, although the final result is mostly that the persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not "vent their hates": Why can’t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Why can’t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "the elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats", why only a male passenger pull him up because of "Road see injustice"?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have made people realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be forced to take away or even be punished on the spot.
This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powerful measures in a timely manner. Trains that do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely manner.
It is the first day of the National Day holiday in October 1. There is a surge in the vehicles heading for Mao County and Songpan County via Beichuan Qiang Minority Autonomous County in Sichuan.
Beichuan Traffic Police received a call for help at about 13:00 saying that a family member had a traffic accident in Songpan and was badly in need of being sent to Mianyang for treatment due to the limited local medical conditions.
However, the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake in Beichuan was under one-way traffic control, so the caller hoped the traffic police would permit the 120 emergency ambulance to pass though the road.
After getting the call for help, the policeman on duty quickly reported this to the traffic police group. After understanding the general situation, the group leader Huang Xuemin immediately arranged the policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job well.
"There were more than 1000 vehicles having entered the controlled road segment at that time. After contacting with the 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would arrive at Beichuan at about 15:00, so we implemented the arrangement and deployment immediately. "
The leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance needed to bypass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake, and the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles in the road segment from running side by side, the traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in the beginning, the middle and the end of the road an hour in advance and reminded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency ambulance.
Later, the policemen of Leigu Squadron also stopped the vehicles entering the controlled road segment temporarily, and asked the vehicles to form a line to make a way for the incoming 120 emergency ambulance.
An emergency ambulance with a "Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan at about 15:00, and Beichuan Traffic Police sent a police car to clear the way and escort the emergency ambulance into the controlled road segment by driving against the traffic.
It was learned that some places on Huanhu Road only permitted one vehicle passing through, and the police implemented the temporary control at these places so that the 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through.
It was impossible to give way in a road segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuanping Town, so the traffic police got in touch with the village party branch and village committee in advance to use the village road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles from entering.
"It only took 40 minutes from Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 emergency ambulance to drive into the normal road of the 302 provincial highway. "
Da Wei explained that the overall passing time needed to be 4 hours under normal circumstances.
"This arrangement has successfully saved precious treatment time for the patient. "
It was learned that the critically ill patient was timely sent to Mianyang for treatment at 17:20.

This is the first pickpocket case cracked by Beijing police during the National Day holiday.
The anti-pickpocket investigators of Beijing Police Mobile Investigation Corps arrived at the designated position at about 5:00 yesterday morning.
According to the previous experience, the places with massive human traffic, including the public transit hubs, bus and subway lines, and even the crowd watching the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square, are the key areas in their work.
In the crowd, the plainclothes policemen were calmly observing the people passing by.
The investigators, who were waiting at the bus station, found two suspicious man following a man to get on No. 20 bus from Yongding Gate Station at about 7:00.
On the bus, the two men standing on the left and right of the male passenger, and one of them tried to provide cover for the other.
But they didn't know that the plainclothes policemen standing by were paying close attention to their every movement.
"Catch the thief with the stolen goods". It was very critical for the plainclothes policemen to choose the timing of catching the thief. While waiting for the men to steal, the policemen had to keep their eyes on them, who were preparing for the pickpocket. As soon as they succeeded in pickpocket, the investigators caught them at one stroke.
The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned that the policemen ferreted out 800 yuan cash from the suspected pickpockets.
"They took the money from the passenger's coat pocket. "
The policeman pointed to a broken coat pocket and said: "They cut it here, and stole 800 yuan cash from a Beijing tourist. When we caught them, they had just put the money into their pocket. "
The reporter learned that the plainclothes policemen had followed the suspected pickpockets for an hour in order to catch them. Finally, they caught them at one stroke when they were committing a crime.
Currently, the two criminal suspects were under the police's examination.
The plainclothes policeman told the reporter that it was easy for the policeman to recognize the suspects in the crowd.
"You will find out that the thieves' eyes and expressions were different from the ordinary passengers' when you have caught a number of thieves. In addition to staring at other people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to get into the crowd instead of avoiding the crowd. "
The policeman also told the reporter that the suspects were often purposeless while waiting for the bus. They liked to wander at the bus station and would follow the target to get on a bus.
"These are the voices of experience. If you have worked as a plainclothes policeman for a long time enough, you will know it quite sensibly. "
Furthermore, the policeman also reminded: "It is the most convenient to put things in the coat pocket, but it will be the easiest to be stolen. "
Mind your own property when you are traveling outside and taking a bus to avoid being stolen.

For activating rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers’ consumption.
According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns.
During the visit to a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the whole village. Stepping into the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, however there are lots of fake good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard to prevent.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a serious problem of fake products, and 66% of users have bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments claim to rectify the rural markets every year, while, why the phenomena of fake products still occur repeatedly?
Different from the urban markets, farmers’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villages are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspection force can’t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
One product has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, and others are for markets, so the functions are overlapped. Strong measures against fake and inferior products have been taken every year, however the central management can only last for a period of time. On one hand, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes just have been dealt and the new fake came out.
Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea of "going to the mountainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas become the "waste elimination markets", both of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development type consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents. The purpose is to make the majority of farmers to "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" and "dare to consume" to let the rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, we must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management policies coming from multiple departments and regulate by more than one departments. According to local conditions, improve the food safety, product quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of each department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities to breed in the countryside.
It is the protection for farmers to severely punish the behavior of entrapping farmers. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers should go down. If there is a problem in any part, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification examinations for production operators. Keep the market circulation, let the products have clear sources and outlet markets. Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy with confidence.
Activate rural consumption, guide the demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, many farmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture and healthy. Thus, rural markets are not equal to "low quality" and "low price".
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms and new modes of consumption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages and towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clear and reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, so that the rural consumption can become more and more prosperous and the farmers’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.

The reporter learned from the Tariff Commission of the State Council that the general tariff level in our country was reduced from 9.8% of the previous year to 7.5%, by an average of 23% after several continuous independent adjustments.
Proper tariff reduction would be beneficial to accelerating the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting the higher-level opening to the outside world, overall planning and using the international and domestic resources, and boosting the domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant responsible person of the Commission said that this year was the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up. Taking the initiative to reduce the general tariff level was the practical action of implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, and our country's important measure of further opening up and actively expanding imports based on our demand for high-quality development. These action and measure showed that China would unswervingly pursue the mutually beneficial opening-up strategy, strengthen the motive of self-development, and deliver benefits to the world through its development.
On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products of Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Red Army millet, black bean, mountain kids madrigal black goat, hardcover buckwheat tea, paper-cutting shadow puppets book, handmade slippers... All pieces of beautifully packaged agricultural products is neatly placed on the stand, they have a common brand name called "Huangxiangren".
"Create a regional brand of "Huanxiangren" has effectively solved the development bottleneck of agricultural products in the Huan County, which is ‘more but not centralized, small and weak’, and it has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation." On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products hosted by Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Huan County is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. It is known as the "National Grain Production Advanced County", "China’s Minor Grain Crops Township" and "China’s Shadow Puppets Township". It has a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow millet wine, buckwheat noodles, and oat noodles are the flavors that people often think of when they are away from their hometown.
As the level of urbanization in China continues to increase, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert on agricultural brand research in China, said: "Currently, urban life is fast-paced and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss their rural life when they were young. However, ‘the place that cannot go back is the hometown, and the most beautiful memory is from the country’, the brand design of ‘Huanxiangren’ is named after the provincialism and homesickness of the wandering people of Huanhuan County. "
The climate conditions in Huan County are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the conditions for planting special minor grain crops are richly endowed by nature.
There are more than 20 kinds of minor grain crops in the county. It is the hometown of China’s minor grain crops, and its output ranks first in Gansu, and its quality is front ranked in the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a Huan County girl who went to school in Tianjin. She participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: "The people in my hometown are the most dear people, and the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful. The brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ has evoked too many homesickness and memories. What I have never forgotten is the food at childhood. I hope that the brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ will go further and further and become bigger and bigger. "
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Academy for National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicators, the detection data of agricultural products such as buckwheat, tartary buckwheat and black beans in Huanxian County are outstanding, and many physiological activators in miscellaneous grains are high. "Huanxiangren" has the inherent advantage of seizing the domestic high-end miscellaneous grains market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the County Committee of the Huan County, said that through the publish of the "Huanxiangren" brand, it can further improve the quality, standardization and scale of innovation and development of quality agricultural products in Huan County, which is conducive to shaping the good overall image of agricultural products in Huan County and rapidly increasing its popularity, competitiveness and added value.

If it does, it will be the fifth time in a bit more than a year that the bank raises interest rates.

The Bank of Canada will announce its next interest rate decision on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Canadian economy has strengthened and the unemployment rate is close to record lows.
Stephen Brown, the senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said that the country's third-quarter GDP was expected to grow at an annualized rate of around 2%.
"This will be 1.5% higher than the expectation of the Bank of Canada, which will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
Overnight index swaps show that the market forecasts for probability of risings of interest rate of the Bank of Canada in October rise from 76.46% to 78.27%.

Report on November 5 of China News: the website of the Chinese embassy in Mongolia reported on November 5 that Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin had been missing when traveling in Mongolia, .
It was understood that these two people were members of the Blue Sky Rescue team. On October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in China and said they would immediately explore the mountains near the Khovsgol Lake. They shared their location via WeChat and then went missing. It was suspected that they had headed for the no man's land.
The Chinese embassy in Mongolia always paid high attention to the protection of the lawful rights and interests and safety of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as well as the consular protection and assistance.
After being informed of the information about the two tourists going missing, the embassy immediately activated the contingency plan for consular protection, strived to seize the prime time for rescue and spared no efforts to work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the two tourists' families, assisted them in immediately reporting the case to the Mongolian police, and provided them with a list of interpreters for their choice.
The embassy made an appointment with the heads of the Mongolian Foreign Relations Department, the General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency at first time to report relevant information. The embassy requested the Mongolian side to carry out the search and rescue operation as soon as possible and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side during the search and rescue process to ensure to keep up the latest progress.

The General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency of Mongolia instructed the police and emergendy department of Hovsgol province to spare no efforts to search and rescue the missing persons.
Since Khovsgol Lake was located at the border of north of Mongolia and Russia, its location was in remote, and it was a vast territory with a sparse population of which transportation and communication was extremely inconvenient. Meanwhile, Mongolia has currently entered the winter, and the temperature was as low as around -20 degrees. The local police and emergency department overcame great difficulties, almost to mobilize all forces and stimulate the local herdsmen to carry out the carpet search and rescue operation around the wide range of the position where two people lost for days on end through the ways of horse riding, walking, and visiting the herdsmen.
Meanwhile, in view of special conditions in the pastoral areas, the Mongolia side has been circularly publishing the notice of missing persons through the radio for days.
Relevant staff of Chinese Blue Sky Rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue work together with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two missing persons has always affected our hearts.
To date, the two people have been lost for more than 10 days. The embassy successively received some clues, but still cannot find them. The search and rescue operation was still under way.
The embassy would always follow the principle of "people first", sustain attention to this matter, push the Mongolian side to continue the all-out search and rescue operation and provide maximum assistance to the two persons' families.
The embassy appeals to the compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese embassy in Mongolia at first time for any relevant clues.
