to become "The Beauty of Munich" in 2018!
In the afternoon there is another surprise waiting for our contestants: they will be competing for the romantic candlelight photo shoot at MY SOLARIS not alone, but together with a male-model Fabian!
Hvar with its flirting, coquetting, and seduction is not an easy task for our girls.
Especially when there is a boyfriend waiting in Germany.
Despite dealing with wind, sprays and rain, the nine contestants of "The Beauty of Munich" behaved like real professionals at the photo shoot with People-photographer Tuan.
You may watch the romantic photoshoot on the video:
The president of DFB Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Özil
Berlin - The president of DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Mesut Özil to the national team.
There is an open question so you get into a conversation, you talk to him about why you have apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
In spite of the debate going on for months about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-match national player Özil.
I would be happy if Mesut Özil continued to play for Germany.
At some point of time I also assumed that it will happen, said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in July and explained it with the fact that Grindel did not protect him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil and that he is not ready for a discussion with national coach and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, but he knows that in football ‘if you leave a team or change club, you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that this discussion did not happen before’.
Linz: Garden shed in allotment gardens burnt down
At 14.13 the Linz professional fire department was notified of a fire in Angererhofweg.
As a high-voltage power line directly traverses the allotment garden, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade drove out and on arrival found the hut fully in flames.
The roof had to be almost completely removed and the huge amount of debris needed clearing.
The owner of the burning garden hut stated that at noon he had connected a battery to the power supply for charging.
This was the possible cause of the fire.
According to the fire department the loading unit was in the most intensive area of the fire.
The damage caused by the fire, and the cause of the fire, still needs to be investigated.
The damage could be considerable as the owner stored many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions?
She apparently wanted to lure the children away from the alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, ‘Herbie: Fully Loaded’) has live streamed how she openly wanted to tear children away from a family in Moscow.
This was reported by US portal "TMZ" with publication of a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see the "Just My Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan gets out of a car and goes up to a possibly homeless family, identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flee in front of the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
Yet she does not offer any proof in the clip.
The whole world is watching, says Lohan in the video as she follows the family further down the street.
She seems to try to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother had it enough.
It looks as if they turn around and Lohan gets a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress protests about how shocked she is - holding her cheek.
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: These are "Mascot's" tasks on the asteroid
The “Hayabusa2” probe launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It should get so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it back to Earth.
The lander “Mascot” will remain on Ryugu.
International news ticker: Number of dead in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are reports of at least 420 casualties.
Reportedly, the number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet progressed into the ravaged and isolated areas.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman
In the beginning, there was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused nervousness on the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal by the electric car manufacturer.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but the parties have now agreed to a settlement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss steps down as chairman, but he may remain as CEO.
The British Conservative Party Conference
Under tight security - the Tory party conference
Birmingham becomes the stage for a power struggle.
The party conference was to address foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference was overshadowed by the conflict between Prime Minister, Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, with ex-Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson in the frontline.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have reached agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about the duplicate name for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
In future, the state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia and the population will vote on this measure on Sunday from the population - will it turn out okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
Ele Nao ("Not him") - addressed to Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil and the mood in the country is divided.
In many cities thousands are taking to the street to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The ‘Brazilian Trump’ is presenting himself as an anti-system candidate and is ahead in the polls.
His keenest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the left workers’ party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration takes longer than planned
There is still a diesel taskforce, said Peter Mertens, chief development officer from the ‘Automobilwoche’ trade journal.
In December 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced, the taskforce will be dissolved soon.
In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.
Mertens now says: ‘At the start of July we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have been worked out.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery at Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers had made ‘serious, organizational changes’, to prevent such a scandal ever happening again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue this discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exhaust emission cheating, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false emission values.
He must have known about the tampering or deliberately ignored it.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
After conversion to the new emissions and consumption standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘Heilbronner Stimme’.
Essentially, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
The segment in itself is a difficult one, he said.
Schot is for electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric automobile.
Grindel seeking re-election - Lahm to join the Presidential Board of the German football association (DFB)
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as President of the DFB again in the coming year.
I do my work and try to make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZDF’s weekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election should be attempted and that is what I will do.
And then you have to see what kind of support you get.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to resign amidst the scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB’s national conference on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join the DFB Presidential Board.
I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will continue to provide advice on the board in this role and then of course we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting matters, said Grindel.
At the same time, he did not want to speculate as to whether or not Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integration.
Currently, this position is filled by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who traces her family back to Cameroon.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says, ‘the issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, ‘this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.
Losing weight the right way with semi-smart scales
I have owned a new toy for four weeks now.
Scales that weigh my body fat percentage as well as my weight.
Even muscle and bone mass can be displayed.
This thing also calculates my body mass index but that is rather useless anyway.
After all, it does not tell me whether I have been replacing fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new German Basketball League season with a sound victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112-55 (52-31) over 40 minutes in a very exciting game.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominating Berlin team with 20 points.
The international Johannes Thiemann from Ludwigsburg (18 points) also showed off his performance in front of 9113 spectators at his competitive debut.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won coach Ainars Bagatskis’ competitive debut with 84-80 (39-37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best scorer of the visitors with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most accurate thrower with 24 points in coach John Patrick’s team .
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season successfully.
Basketball Löwen Braunschweig had a clear victory with 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburg team with 25 points.
The Braunschweig team, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the season started, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run tells it all.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdoğan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite adherents of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to unsettle our citizens and damage the German/Turkish friendship’, he said.
Inner city Cologne was partially blocked for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Many thousands of police were deployed, including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic association is under criticism because it is seen as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: Stars, boos and scary moments
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B campaigned for more engagement in the fight against poverty and illness at a collective concert in New York’s Central Park.
Get involved wherever you can, said Mendes on Sunday evening at the festival in front of approximately 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with tassels and a gold microphone.
I am nervous, I am sweating, but it’s OK because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Even actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, government representatives, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on the stage at the spectacle, which lasted for hours.
There was a scary moment when many spectators mistook the noise of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to run away.
There was a short panic with people running in all directions.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the audience from the stage.
Nobody is trying to injure anyone, said Martin.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge online.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases online.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - by contrast, Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
Flake did join his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage in calling for more equal rights between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate supporting the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, which offended many women.
At least three women made abuse allegations, including some of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects these.
Flake called for an FBI investigation after two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves confronted him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
You are welcome to join me in an elevator anytime, Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of Press: Federal government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German writing “Freedom for journalists” and was sitting in the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said to the Bild on Sunday.
It was about a disruption in the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action created a lot of unrest, which was unacceptable.
Thus, he ordered bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the federal chancellery.
no matter if it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or supporting or being members of prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible for the failed attempted coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing several decades in jail.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the incarcerated journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but the legal processes in Turkey against the two are still ongoing.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans normally know him to be so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, though: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” [Ina's Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheery conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “Schellfischposten.”
Moderator Ina Müller often cheers her guests with a beer, some wine or even stronger beverages to loosen up the mood and their tongues.
Quite a few celebs also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip didn’t do the actor any good, though.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled, only two small slits for eyes.
The bed selfie showed a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has quite a hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.
Rule two: Never drink "die schwarze Sau".
And Spritz.
And also pass on Ina’s round of eggnog at half past two."
The long night is really showing on the 43-year-olds’ face.
His fans posted a couple of tips for getting rid of a hangover.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - painkillers.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
We still don't know how Ina Müller survived the binge drinking at night.
Since she has hosted the wild TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much better prepared...
Out for a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has struggled against vandalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavily littered.
Attempts are made to remedy the rampant vandalism, but there are hardly any signs of solutions.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle path, which is the flagship object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body.
There is no solution so far.
Suggestions ranged from transferring the seating area to the regular emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.
I think, the latter would be the order of the day, irrespective of any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issue up with the local advisory council.
Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular meeting place for partying.
It is not just about the noise, there are also disturbances due to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up, explains the ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area at the cycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.
Clearly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who now is also responsible for the cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
If it suffers the same fate, it will cost dearly.
Another idea is placing video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this raises the threshold to engage in damaging common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to come out.
In principle, Wüstenhagen supports the development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
So far one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle path is frequented.
It is still possible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Our cycle track is of very high quality compared to others in German’, agreed the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane on Haaße Hügel.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may end up waiting in the middle of bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.
That would not be a problem for sporty cyclists, but is for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the culture train station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call to participate in the music contest was a success, creative and cooperative.
Your Song for Hiltrup is the motto of the Hiltrup initiative for the "Music Contest for young and old, new and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink from the lovely Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it soon became a familial togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, from a one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrup man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
This contest is a novelty, explains district mayor Joachim Schmidt.
We have not seen something like this in other districts.
What did the songwriters sing about?
Particularly popular places were the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the song to the avenue Marktalle in his folk-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also mentioned.
Over and over again, the acts sang about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke led the audience through the breaks with short interviews with the performers or some information about the artists.
Thus, the audience learnt that Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest as a main act.
And Alvin Jasic has uploaded a lot of YouTube videos.
It’s not about winning, Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup catering businesses.
For the jury's favorites there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the “Lummerland pack:” “a very good performance” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children also performed again for the finals - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
They considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: Testing "Decrypto"
The players form two teams and sit opposite one another.
For each page there is a screen, on it there are four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil.
This ensures the other side cannot read anything unintentionally.
For example, on the cards it says to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Fenster.
3. Cube.
4. Solidʺ.
These are the terms that need to be coded.
So the terms are not guessed, the codes are.
Taking turns, one player per team is the encryptor.
They get a code card that has "3.4.2." etc. written on it.
In "Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret film that should be guessed, but their encryption codes.
The task in this case: They should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube", "solid" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, because the team that cracks the code twice wins the game.
The encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to "solid". Of course, something like "evidence" would be possible or "Prague" because he read some history books and knows about the defenestration of Prague.
This then progresses, round for round, team by team.
It is true that one does not know the terms of the other side - but with every clue the encryptor gives, you’re closer to finding them out.
So the term should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy. Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic ‘Decrypto’ is the precept unfortunately.
The players have to study it for quite a long time and in detail, until they can finally play it.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the web will make it easier.
But once you have started, you’ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a game with few words, but it’s much easier to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's easy to play a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man gives police the Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
During the night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year old man gave the police station in Kulmbach twice something to do.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the upper town, later he was also found in the upper town in a pub where he harassed other guests.
After clearly under the influence of alcohol he did not comply with the police order to vacate the premises, he had to spend the night in the detention cell in the police station of Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to take legal responsibility for the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations.
The Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives
For decades the depot in Pressig was the hub of the Franconian Forest.
1991 put an end to a piece of railway history.
The crashing from bumper to bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This did not bother anybody.
The squeaking of brakes and rattling of carriages could also be heard.
This was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel’s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a place been characterized by the railway so much.
This was the starting point for the steep mountain section to the north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of about 220 meters.
Previously trains and locomotives housed in Pressig were needed to handle this.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and railroad maintenance division.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 years of experience.
The Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomotives.
From 1977 they were still used with freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and the remainder in the year 1991.
Heidrich: ‘It’s a shame that better use of the location is not envisaged, also with regard to freight traffic’.
Still in the year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station festival for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg Dinkel.
Shortly afterwards.
On June 1, 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
The shunters and wheel scotches took care of the heaviest rail traffic work, remembers Dinkel.
Each mistake could have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to a change in the hierarchy of both locations and how many more historical and current pictures there are, is included here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with initial success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing, just as Julia Görges before.
Kerber won 6:2 at the China Open against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Carla Suárez Navarro from Spain.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Daria Kassatkina, when the Russian athlete on rank 13 gave up.
The Swabian will now face Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
On the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach.
Organisers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the special vernissage of the "Windspiel-Performance" which took place in the open air on the Dahlmann-Schmidt property in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around Walberla) in the framework of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors for the 15th year.
The large number of visitors showed the fascination with the exhibits.
21 exhibits from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
The host Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the exhibition.
He had been there from the first hour.
As has Volker Hahn, who has made a name for himself as the main organiser as well as an artist.
It was a little surprising when Hahn announced his retirement some days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task in experienced, young hands with excellent future prospects.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped in designing flyers.
Once again this year there will be a 70 cent special stamp designed on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss (art and enjoyment), available at every art station.
The poster this year ‘outdance the Betzn’, designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn enjoyed the excellent reception of the special exhibit.
It was possible to persuade Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg to provide musical framing.
The visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
There are metal or ceramic works of art, often accented with color.
Already at the entrance to the property, on the right side, the visitor is awaited by the "Glücksbaum" (luck tree) by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened with color, equipped with 20 pin wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes for a sound piece.
The sun shining through the bushes in the background adds a magical touch to the object, inviting visitors to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to dedicate three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway through the path Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind" (The Wind the Heavenly Child).
At the end, Volker Hahn demonstrates his colorful fantasy created from clay, cement and stainless steel.
The ‘wind chime performance’ theme wanders through the multi-purpose art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be viewed until December 31, 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - That was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the people of Albachten demonstrated their anger.
At least five of them.
In no case did they want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there would be no more singing life in the district.
It has become a legend by now: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, the MGV 68 came to existence.
That was 50 years ago.
Now there will be a big anniversary celebration in the “House of Encounter.”
It will be full today, senses chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.
There are 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.
It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break for the first time.
The traditional festival was back again in time for the 50th anniversary.
It became an elegant ball and formal clothing had been requested beforehand.
Guests did not sit in rows as usual in the “House of Encounter,” but rather sat comfortably around tables.
In between, everyone could dance. DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and heated up the dance floor.
Of course, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten would let their voices sound.
Matching the occasion, happy songs were quite fitting.
Almost set: "So ein Tag, so wunderschön wie heute."
There was also the “Rüdesheim wine” to go with the exquisite grape juice, which many guests had in front of them.
“Humulus lupulus,” which is the Latin name for ‘hops,’ references another cool drink.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch back then, was once again very confident.
It's just fun to sing under his direction, said Holstiege. "He has such an easy way, he accomplishes a masterpiece every time.". By the way, this time not only men were presented vocally.
The ladies’ choir “High C” were also guests, whose repertoire above all includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
To round it all off there was some poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodic poetry.
There was also a big Tombola game.
The proceeds are to go towards financing the children of the Albatros Youth Center visiting the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserves, under the patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or getting the heebie-jeebies. The independents are doing their thing.
And with the 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals BW Aasee, they did really well.
It wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression, says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed with him: “This is a defeat that we can live with.
We are not dissatisfied.” Quite the contrary.
In the evening, at Ronja de Boer’s belated birthday party, the mood was good, the game was done.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
If you bring it to the finish, such a game can also tip over quite easily, Büring knows from years of experience.
Ultimately USC made everything clear with its experienced players and finished it out.
We all know who is on the other side in such a derby.
That was not our undoing.
I've seen a great game of volleyball at times, Annacker did not struggle with the 0-3 and went straight back to the agenda.
After just three matchdays, it does not seem foreseeable where the independents’ journey goes.
It’s simply too early for that, says Axel Büring.
He only feels vindicated in one thing: “The 3rd Women's League has an unbelievably good level of play.
It’s not even close with regional league volleyball.” They don't even want to look down towards the fourth league.
If they don’t want to lose hope, they have to look up.
But a conclusion can't be drawn until after ten or eleven games.
The next game is at Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee will compete in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel she was enough for her husband
The "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series could have had some influence on her divorce with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) became famous in her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘Dream Boat’, but on 01 January 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star might be one of the reasons of her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had been married for ten years.
This could also have been a reason.
Because this work became a part of me, I traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".
She used to be "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Dream Ship".
Because now journalists called her only as Heide Keller.
I don’t know if he was happy with this.
She thinks that it possible that her husband might have been jealous at the time, but "as many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always made effort for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to discover my fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language it means: I’m pretending," as she explains further.
She always had the feeling of ‘not being enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which actually I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever’.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said ‘Yes’ again, ‘although I was scared it could go wrong again’.
The day before the civil marriage, I sat in the changing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody failed as well.
Why did it never work out with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller was in love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not compatible with daily life.
I am too naive to approach love."
The moth, who regularly explores the city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich area, has now attempted this on the ZFF opening party.
Not really a moth, just a little shady.
And the shiny glare, in which a green carpet is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
It is the film festival though, where the more or less famous want to bathe in the spotlight.
So this late Thursday evening he tottered across the square, to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, whatever the reason, it literally stinks in the gents area.
So out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening film "Green Book", like every year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown originate from the whole globe.
What do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall into hidden advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother has sent him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass inside.
Inside, the invited are crowded together, they dance way past midnight to live music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
In the delicatessen in the basement oysters await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the highlight is: that the shop shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the event.
It has been like this for years and seems to function without any major losses.
You must just love the country for it!
The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Please be careful on the escalator if you are wearing a long dress".
Should this be two separate instructions, he has ignored the dress code.
However, it is a conditional construction that has undoubtedly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips down a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", which is suited to the festival award.
The mixture getting the prize for the best drink, presented by a capsule manufacturer - not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for the brand mentioned for years, is also not there on the evening.
There is one face, however, between local notables, cash desk and kitchenware, that is familiar to the spectators: Peter Farrelly, Director of the opening film.
Its main character will not be far away.
And in reality: Immediately, Viggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty walks through the crowd appearing almost like a choir boy.
He is not talked into, not gaped at, at the most he receives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken for inhibition, is why the international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with a Cumbia dance
Trainer and ex-footballer, Diego Maradona is delighted at his team’s victory.
Argentina’s football legend, Diego Maradona has clearly settled well in his new homeland Mexico.
The 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the changing room to Cumbia rhythms after a 2:0 victory for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, as shown in a video already released on Saturday.
A team member’s 15-second clip shows Maradona dancing in a yellow strip, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second league team defeated Leones Negros 2:0.
After the game Maradona said to a TV camera ‘Time after time with my boys’.
Since the beginning of September the 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute loss
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat.” His protégés were “devastated” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourth in four games - Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
Over long periods, they had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly.
We only overslept the initial phase, said the ASV coach annoyed.
Quickly, the home team led with 8-1, also the early break, that Bieletzki had taken, did not pan out.
But then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletzki.
At halftime, they were only two goals behind.
Senden's best player, Marius Hintze, kept scoring in phase one.
After the change, things got even better from the visitors’ point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized for 15-15.
Four minutes before the alarm, the lead was still only three goals (29-26).
And then?
The impartial got in on the action.
Bieletzki usually does not seek blame with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty caused by Steffen Mühlhoff “was a joke.”
LIT had an opportunity and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, defended well and repeatedly threw the ball on the empty goal.
But compliments don’t win games.
Now it must be a damned victory, said Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a (then) 18 year old Naila (district of Hof), police are searching for the remains of the woman.
Response services dug up a street on Saturday near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers were removed below, as police and prosecutors announced.
According to new findings, the missing woman may have been buried not far from her former home.
The woman disappeared on November 4, 1986.
Investigators at the time did not rule out foul play.
According to information, since last year the criminal investigation department of Hof has been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecution department.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators discovered a conspicuous feature under the road in Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials were able to limit the area to a few yaars.
The results of the excavations are to be announced this afternoon.
The hacking attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers that lurk online.
Users themselves can also take care of additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their online accounts.
In addition, security updates, such as those for Windows, should be quickly installed and there is no harm in equipping computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatened dismissal as the chief executive of the billion dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled a lawsuit out of court regarding misleading Tweets in which Musk could have lost his ability to manage listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla are each paying 20 million US dollars. In addition, Musk is giving the office of chairman up for three years.
He may stay CEO, though.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC has sued the world-famous manager in the US federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the electric car pioneer currently posting losses, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk unaware of any wrongdoing
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and is very sad and disappointed about the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth and transparency and with his investors in mind.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he would maybe remove the company from the stock exchange and pay 420 US dollars per share. The financing was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at 72 billion dollars.
Musk later backpedaled: Tesla remains a listed company.
According to the agreement, Tesla now has to find external chairman, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Shortly before closing Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a curler into the corner.
Record champion Manchester United is sliding deeper into crisis following the worst season start since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho earned a justified lost at West Ham United 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven matchdays only in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against Valencia on Tuesday.
The former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after Petr Cech was injured.

Survey: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of recent weeks, the grand coalition conceded several poll low blows.
A survey indicates that the SPD falls behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is reviewed critically.
Berlin - For the first time the AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the polling institute, the AfD has gained one point and holds 17 percent, the SPD, compared to the previous week, has lost a point and holds 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a point and hold only 27 percent.
So far this is the lowest rating for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens achieve 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday were the Bundestag election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes according to Emnid.
The large coalition for all the large research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, lost the majority in the ‘Sunday question’.
The government parties are coming up with 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 general election, together they received 53.4 percent.
The bandwidth is also great for the other parties: The AfD, in many polls holds the position of second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens receive vote quotas of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The Left have an average of 10 percent, the FDP 9 percent.
Such surveys have an uncertainty of plus/minus 2 to 3 percent, according to statistical reasons, depending on the share of votes.
Since the 2017 general election however the backing for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly in the population.
Currently only 48 percent of citizens believe Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as is revealed in the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
Only one in two (50 percent) in the survey want a grand coalition by the next regular parliamentary election in three years, 41 percent want a re-election.
Even in another survey published on Saturday clear losses in approval for Merkel were noted.
Divided was also the assessment of Germans concerning whether in December Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.
In the case of the unionists, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Poster at Aldi: Love at a discount
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that there are no romantic "How we met"-stories anymore in times of Tinder, should head over to Aldi and talk about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and other dating apps, the supermarket exudes an almost anachronistic romance as a place to meet ‘the one’.
Yeah, right. If in doubt, talking about discounted turkey meat, boxer shorts at the rummage table, or your favorite pudding is still a better story for your future grandchildren than a mere right swipe.
The app Tinder has the reputation of being less of a place to meet, but rather more of lewd exchange.
We made the test: How do women react, if you do not beat around the bush in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
There’s true Hollywood Lovestory potential with a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then messages his inamorata with the e-mail address organic-turkeymeat@gmail.com, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - Romantic Comedy at its best.
So, we wish the creator of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find the man of her dreams, with whom she had talked briefly about the "Organic turkey meat, 30 percent off".
We should all believe in the magic of analogue acquaintance. This woman definitely earned her Hollywood happy ending.
Billerbeck: 500 caps for a life without polio
Since the start of the new school year the Ludgerischule has been involved in the action ‘Caps against Polio - 500 caps for a life without polio’.
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus.
The disease referred to in German as child paralysis (Kinderlähmung) causes paralysis and even death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
A press release stated that to date the cause of poliomyelitis, the poliovirus, can only be contained by vaccination.
Soccer: Reus and Zorc demand rest for Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on Mario Götze’s shape and fitness.
We should stop worrying about Mario.
That does not do him any good.
And it also does not do us any good, said Reuss, Götze’s friend, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen in an interview with the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized this before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.
Football: Eberl: No rush for contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from Bundesliga soccer team Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see any rush for a possible contract extension with trainer Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a contract up to now.
There is no fixed date when we will do so.
There will certainly come a moment, when we sit down and talk, said Eberl on Sunday evening on the Sky TV channel.
Football: District League: Strong appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives hope
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on his team.
Silently, the coach of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on the playing field.
All is history.
Meanwhile, the game is on at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine proved so, and they almost got promoted past season.
Yes, I am very happy with the appearance.
We made tightened spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of, praised Fetsch his boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply say "thank you" for the great defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly changed into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for passes to him.
Wolbeck had much more time of possession in the first half.
And more opportunities
But Frerichs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost backfired when SCA’s very own Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer made two dangerous attacks against Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After halftime, VfL boldly took complete control.
Thewes just barely failed with a shot from 18 meters.
Schroer was too late in minute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetsch decided to freshen up the team on the left wing and put in Miles Geske.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in minute 70, the home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal.
The fouled player himself stepped up and demonstrated how dangerous he can be in set play situations.
Westhues kicked the ball with his strong right and the goalie had to face the fact that he had failed: 1:0 (minute 71).
With 20 minutes left on the clock, the game seemed to last forever.
Because then this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally touched the ball in the box.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider was not ready to miss this opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck had to endure long minutes in the final stage, when Geske finally managed to finally get that ball into the goal and secure the winning goal in minute 87.
That might have been overkill.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th minute L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th minute Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt beats Hannover 96 4:1
Background: Four points after five match days - coach Adi Hütter was not going to be happy with that.
Eintracht Frankfurt wanted to take the first home victory at last against Hannover 96.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, the accident happened at the airfield.
The four pasengers were slightly injured.
Around 14:00 drama occurred at the airport in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crash to the ground and came to land on its side.
The police, rescue services and fire department were notified immediately.
A large number of emergency services arrived at the site of the accident.
The ÖAMTC emergency rescue helicopter was also called as a precaution.
Passenger only slightly injured

AllBright Foundation Report: Women continue to be a rarity on executive boards
Only 8 percent of board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Monday by the AllBright Foundation, an advance copy of which had been made available to the German Press Agency.
The companies will have to make changes, otherwise international competitors will leave them behind, said foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, UK, or Sweden, male-only management teams have - with a few exceptions - been unthinkable for some time.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative, and future-oriented by comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the number of women in German listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companies in the mid-cap index (MDax).
Yet according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of boards are female.
In the previous year the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, there were 26 women working on the boards.
I am sure that Dax companies will be recruiting women more consistently in the coming year - it is in their own best interest, said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement showed no commitment to increase the “zero percent” to date.
The supervisory boards paint a different picture: As of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
If multiple women were recruited to the boards every year, a percentage of 40 percent would be achieved in 2023, it says in the report.

On this issue have been working the "Autopapst" and Professor of Economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows: The difference is significant.
Within the first half of year Ferrari got 69,000 euros of business profit for each sold car, Jaguar Land Rover only comes to around 800 euros, whereas Tesla and Bentley do not put emphasis on their income from each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are approaching with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros Earnings Before Interest and Tax.

Torchlight procession to open the 60th Abtswind wine festival
With a torchlight parade, the tourism association of Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time the association organises the wine festivals which take place consecutively on every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on the Rehweiler road.
At the start of the jubilee the organisers, accompanied by the marching band from Wiesenbronn, moved through the town to the fairground.
The chairman of the tourist board, Wolfgang Starz, the mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess, Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already jam-packed marquee. ‘60 years to set something like this up, is a titanic challenge for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
‘This is a proud achievement’, said Starz thanking all the helpers.
Later the wine princess Lisa II symbolically clinked glasses with the guests from the stage.
It is great that so many have found their way to us in Abtswind. Later, "Die Troglauer" created good mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih (parish fair) was celebrated, the association set the drink prices in the afternoon as they were 60 years to celebrate the anniversary.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the house of the guests, before the next round, a day later in the festival tent.

An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year old passenger was fatally injured when the ambulance collided with a taxi.
When emergency responders are called, they are supposed to help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn had a fatal end for a 26 year old.
Bonn - A 26 year old pedestrian was fatally injured when an ambulance collided with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency responder and her driver were seriously injured, police stated.
The 46 year old driver of the ambulance ran a red light on Saturday afternoon with the blue lights flashing and siren sounding.
He then crashed into a taxi at a crossroads that drove at the green light.
The doctor's car flew against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
He swept away the passerby who died at the scene.
The ambulance driver and the taxi driver are seriously injured
The 62 year old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured and trapped in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another emergency responder tried to do this, but without success.
The three seriously injured parties were taken to the hospital.
The police investigates in close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor, to find out who bears the blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, Mourinho’s situation is becoming uncomfortable
After the embarassing exit from the League Cup Manchester United now receives a loss in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU looses 1:3. The way of defeat certainly will remain a matter of discussion.
The scene in the 74th minute, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3:1, was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford appeared to bring the Red Devils back into the game.
As the team suspected an offside in the pass by Mark Nobel, all of Manchester’s defensive players froze in position, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of a very inadequate performance over long stretches.
The mood of United’s city rival, Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho’s big rival Pep Guardiola scored against Brighton & Hove Albion for an unchallenged 2:0 win.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling made the first breakthrough, through the defense of the outsiders, for the home team.
After a good hour Sergio Agüero secured the way for the sixth win in seven game, through a double pass of the previous goal scorer, which sprung the team to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer table leader
Three days after losing 1:2 at the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 with Liverpool against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As at the Cup exit the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man for the London team.
The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute was the only goal of match until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who replaced Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute only closely missed the tie goal after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his curl.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First, the London team eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the League, the Blues removed Liverpool now also from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs celebrated 2:0 wins against Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford).
The fans of the Gunners, under whose eyes Granit Xhaka played, against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, however, had to wait until the 81st minute wait for a success message.
Nine minutes before the end of the game the Watford defender Craig Cathcart unleashed a cross-field ball past Alex Iwobi into one’s own net. Only two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season which was decisive.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to its fifth successive win and are now fifth, just behind the great rivals Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to leave a strong impression as a team climbing in position under the Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row in the League with a 2:0 win over Southampton which places them in the eighth place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show marked by diesel debate
The Parisian automobile show takes place every two years in rotation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet immanent The diesel scandal and struggle for bans on driving and upgrading should not let German car companies take part in the industry meeting in Paris.
Next week they will be showing their new products at the 2018 Motor Show in the capital of French together with its competitors from all over the world.
The diesel does not really matter now.
The possible exchange and modernization offers for diesel engines owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important topic at least behind shiny exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the VW core brand itself.
Here are presented Audi and Mercedes-Benz, including their first pure-electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt should come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented however.
The launch of BMW iNext is scheduled for 2021.
In the focus of attention in Paris is the new 3ER.
This year from October 4 to 14, more than 250 exhibitors are being represented.
In addition to the car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers will be there in their individual halls.
The trade show, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in rotation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 came over one million visitors.
At least 380 people have lost their lives on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken on Friday by two earthquakes.
The first quake was of magnitude 5.9, the second of magnitude 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged among the severe property damage.
After the earthquake the tsunami erupted over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will definitely increase.
Numbers are so far only from Palu.
But numerous other communities along Sulawesi's west coast are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate a church service in Werdohl
On Sunday, Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne, celebrated the concluding service with a team of helpers for motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the concluding service for the bikers was to be held here.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor in the Evangelical church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral interests of the high-HP cyclists.
Between April and September on the last Sunday of the month, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Nordhelle house.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
There, some 150 bikers gathered on Sunday for a church service that was anything but ordinary.
Starting from 10 am, the heavy bikes lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
The biker brunch was the first agenda item and attendees had a chance to tuck into some coffee and cake or even a hearty Currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also in attendance.
Priest Dirk Grzegorek gave a sermon during the biker church service.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill accompanied the service with her music.
Although the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill struck rather calm and poetic notes, said pastor Frank Schröder.
This was definitely a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorf's Home Association celebrates a major festival: The milk comes after the apple
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a big amount of interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the life of an apple to his astonished spectators step by step from the ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg had help from the children to fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink was to be made from it.
But they could even witness this important step on the late Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, which looked a bit like chopped shreds.
Thanks to certain technical support, the last work step was now no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a big vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his “treasure chest” and presented the latest Federweisser [alcoholic beverage] to the older visitors.
There was a lot of demand for the good “Made in Füchtorf” beverage.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents got to talking while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been set up.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited people to join in fun games at several stations.
The Home Association will also offer an action day next year.
Then, however, emphasized Gregor Krützkamp, the community center in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the site of the action.
Instead, a farmer will be visited.
That is also obvious because of the topic: Because then, it will all be about milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover facing fourth washout this season: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there were not many positives to take away from the bottom team’s earlier 1:4 (0:2) result at Eintracht Frankfurt.
It is a crappy situation, but you have to come out on the other side as a team, said 96 player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "This is of course disappointing, because you always try for the best result possible".
Victory continues to elude the players from Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored to narrow the gap. They remain at the bottom of the table with only two points and must be considered a relegation candidate in their current form.
By contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic led Frankfurt to celebrate their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,300 spectators. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, Frankfurt move into the middle of the table on seven points.
Croatia’s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive move by the Hessians at his starting eleven debut while Hannover’s defense struggled to reign him in.
The striker battered after the World Cup, showed by his tempo and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was called up to Frankfurt’s starting eleven for the first time and the team got off to a dynamic start.
The first sign of danger came in the form of Lucas Torró’s header (17th), which was deflected into the netting.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped by 96’s defense in a promising position. The defenders were led by the Brazilian Felipe, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-minute back injury.
The home side’s lead was all but inevitable and completely justified.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the box and Haller headed it in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to tap it in.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender from French second division team AJ Auxerre who had joined the club during the summer.
And Frankfurt increased the tally before the break.
This time, Haller passed to his fellow striker Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.
The Lower Saxony side showed more courage going forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until just before the end of the match when they at least managed to score and narrow the gap.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour Rebic started a solo and then crossed to De Guzmán, who just tapped the ball into the empty goal.
Playing against overstretched guests, Frankfurt could take it easy for the rest of the match, which also saw Jovic scoring with one minute to go.
The Morlaixplatz turns into a party strip
Würselen Despite the cool temperatures, the atmosphere was great at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
In front of millions of spectators, Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter opened the 185th
Münchener Wies’n last week needing only two strokes.
Geisingen: Christians in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross festival
Catholics in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or on the Sunday after.
The festival service takes place at the town church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the blessing.
At the Church of the Holy Cross lies Christus, who witnessed the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the Christus' resting place, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
The construction is not finished yet, only the sanctuary is, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Inspite of the importance for the Geising parish, attendance was rather poor.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing concluded the ecclesiastical part of the cross festival.
The Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home for many years.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a big selection of cakes and, appropriate for the weather, farm-fresh ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which will last until next year.
After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls for bids could be prepare more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the already existing damage hase worsended over the last few years, but also more damaged has been uncovered, which was only possible through the inspection by means of the scaffold.
The plinth plastering work is completed and before the winter, the natural stone work will begin and the involved parties hope to finish about half of this work this year.
Opening ceremony: New residential home in Neu-Ulm’s Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller life aid is opening a new hostel for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those attending the ceremony agreed that "a very special house" is now opening its doors for its intended purpose.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home provided by Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, depend on its unique architecture.
Wider aisles, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have all been part of architect Rudolf Bader’s concept.
Planning first began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officers’building was tested for its suitability for residents with disabilities: "The house was getting old and no longer up-to-date in terms of features," Bader explained looking back.
In 2016, excavators started rolling to demolish the house.
The new building was to be designed to be as welcoming and bright as possible, so that the residents could feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residential home
The life aid invested approximately 4.6 million euro in the new construction.
The state of Bavaria contributed 2.4 million Euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 Euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financially.
The Lebenshilfe’s managing director Jürgen Heinz thanked Bader this accomplishment.
The balance between a barrier-free and fireproof design has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and handymen built a home with many specifications, to allow residents the freedom to move even without outside help.
The same was expressed by the head of social services in the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer: ‘The home is geared towards the special requirements of its residents, who need help with mobility’.
Comfort and functionality have been combined to good effect in the process, said Kreutmayer.
And also: ‘The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it no longer needs to be acquired in today’s situation’.
All in all, the new residential home on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are paid union wages.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the anniversary of German unification, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to the nation not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity
We cannot permit ourselves to be satisfied with these differences,” said the minister president of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the “Tagesspiegel” on Sunday.
The goals must remain the same: to create equal living conditions across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans work longer on average than people in Western Germany, but receive 15 percent less salary.
This is inexplicable, nearly 30 years after the German Unification, said Schwesig.
North Korea: Is this cute dog going to end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is to pour oil on troubled water between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has given the South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hounds as a gift.
On Sunday, Moons office announced that both dogs, about a year old reached the recipient already on Thursday.
They passed through the Panmunjom border with three kilograms of dog food, to help the animals ‘to settle in’.
The dogs with their thick, white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift was announced by the North at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to make a joint candidancy for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the process of the mutual rapprochement, Kim agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test system for rocket propulsion.
99 documents reflect Austria's eventful history
What is Austria?
At the 100-year anniversary of the republic that has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, many new books appeared that answer this question mainly looking back over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, takes a very different approach in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published on October 1.
A new week, a new opportunity for the government
Back to regulatory work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also lastly from the CSU did not invoke the mantra "return to work".
That may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference really is between work and paperwork, but that's all.
Now the federal government is ready to devote itself again to the task of governing, they should not be distracted from this now with debates on terminology.
Whether Union and SPD can pull off something together after the provocations and disgraces of recent weeks, will possibly be seen on Monday.
The leaders of the governing parties will come together for the coalition committee in the evening.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to summon this session regularly, to defuse conflicts early on; lessons can be learned from all the disputes.
First of all, however, conflict-laden topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufacturers to be under obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labor immigration law.
The SPD promotes a long-term perspective for failed asylum-seekers, who work or who are training.
The Union is strictly against the "track change" from the asylum system into the labor market.
There will be disputes amongst the coalition partners again - how could this be otherwise?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a subscribed society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But to be constructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons regarding the question of being or not-being.
It is about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to argue - but must always have the reality of life of the people in view.
What is possible and is of benefit to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and confidence thereby regained.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must now fight for.
Pilz is investigating the Hartinger’s working hours
Close eyes on Minister
Is the Ministor for Labor in violation of labor law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to investigate this in more detail.
Seriously, day and night, her legists had worked on the social security reform, reported the social minister at the presentation of the reform two weeks ago exuberantly.
Liste Pilz candidate Daniela Holzinger is surprised by Beate Hartinger-Klein’s statement (FPÖ) - she brings this to the parliament’s attention now.
She assumes that ‘the minister is only trying to express her enthusiasm about the engagement of her team, and did not intend to convey any possible violations of the labor law with the cameras rolling’.
Nevertheless, now there are unanswered questions to acquit Hartinger "of any suspicion."
The police dig up a road in search of a woman’s corpse
Marxgrün - Lange did not want to comment on the matter to the police.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning digging has taken place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track in the Marxgrün area will be closed until Monday.
Earlier it had taken place that the investigator had used an archeology dog.
The dog together with his guide, trained especially for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant area to a few metres.
A soil anomaly was also discovered with scientists from Munich’s Technical University and the supreme Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the road section mentioned.
For more than a year already the prosecutor and Criminal Police from Hof had worked on the case of the missing.
A cycle track was closed again and again at Marxgründ and investigated with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspected that Heike’s body could have been buried during the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colored powder and eggs: Protests in Barcelona before the Catalonia’s anniversary
The controversial independence referendum took place on Monday in Catalonia.
But right before it begun the protests.
The autumn 2017 police operation was not forgotten by the separatists.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, in the downtown of Barcelona separatists clashed with police.
Among other things Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with colored powder, as they were trying to prevent them from approaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Guards.
With the demonstration about 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last year during the illegal referendum.
An attempt to prevent citizens from voting lead to violence.
The Spanish media reported that the Catalan police formed a chain to keep the separatists and central security forces apart.
However, some of the about 6000 separatists tried to break the police chain by force, and were throwing at officials, among other things, paint bombs and eggs.
Citing the authorities it was said that six people had been arrested and 24 other were slightly injured.
The independence referendum took place for the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and subsequent decision to split off the prosperous region from Spain, in autumn 2017 the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under control.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont has fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also escaped abroad.
However, several ministers of then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
In December in the region were held new elections.
After the new Catalan government's inauguration in May, the forced administration was terminated.
Yet the new president insists on the ‘Right of self-determination’ of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete helplessness: Goalless match between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rot-Weiß Ahlen still going nowhere.
FC Gütersloh only didn’t get further than a 0-0 draw.
The tail light and the third last of the league demonstrated complete helplessness in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
The first half was rather dim in terms of entertainment.
Anyone who wanted to go get a beer or bratwurst could do it without worrying they would miss anything.
There was no risk of missing a goal opportunity, because there were virtually none.
The first shot on goal happened after half an hour.
Responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh’s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz’ shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area in minute 32.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early substitution.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury. Sinan Aygün replaced him.
After the substitution, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goal from 18 meters and after one hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, this was quickly dealt with.
Nick Flock (minute 62) "crowned" the quick counterattack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they went one better with a header from Wieckowicz (minute 66) after a corner from former Ahlen player Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, substituting Martin Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and a little later Sebastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minute 70).
That lead to nothing.
The team from Ahlen did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but that did not get them anywhere.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like that we kept a clean sheet." But unfortunately, both sides scored zero.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this match as against Holzwickede, even though our opponents did not want to play here, states RW Ahlen’s interim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I did not feel that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the viewer did not feel like his team could score a goal, either.
The performance was too poor for that.
Thanksgiving Market in Reckenfeld: Good thing there are enough Kreimers
That is good news for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann, and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld food bank, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers clarify: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening the sky was a brilliant blue, but the square was a little empty, which was to change over the day.
Because: "It is such a friendly atmosphere, that is why we are here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in a Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a bit of humor.
At short notice, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stood in for the Brockmanns, who were to be weighed against food.
Ferdi Kreimer’s daughter Verena had fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers anyway.
And the "substitute" insisted on musically entertaining the ever increasing number of visitors.
This was so well received that people sang along to some folk songs late at night.
Just great, said a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
This year, mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule.
He is happy to see so many engaged people manning their stands, most of them hailing from clubs and associations.
Strictly speaking, there should be no need for things like food banks, he said when thanking the men’s choir for their efforts.
Andreas Hajek praised everybody’s engagement, in the stands, and also included the additional festivals that took place in September and the ‘clean-up’ action.
Our garden city is getting a colorful coat of paint - things are really happening.
Next, the wreath was taken down from the maypole by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken into winter storage.
Many stands worked to provide sustenance.
Everything from sweet to savory was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative about his scroll saw.
He offered veneer designs and beer mats with typical Reckenfeld motifs, among other things.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a special treat: "Reckenfeld honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty on hand.
Gingerbread in a glass, with honey from my own production of course.
Little Elsa kept coming back for seconds, that is how good the cake was.
It is this friendly atmosphere that makes visitors stay late into the evening hours even in the absence of stage events, which are not part of the fall festival.
Graffiti with a local political message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have advocated for the construction of a skate park in a hardly beneficial way.
In several places, there are graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint for property damage has been filed with the police.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed in large letters on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that writing was found on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro on September 19 after the career choice fair.
Since the short message was apparently "only" made with a marker, it could easily be removed.
A few days later, it was there again, but this time it was sprayed on, says Rottmann.
He assumes that the respective advertising sign has to be replaced.
This case is special by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of schools, sports and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the graffitied board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of a skate park.
After the old had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began.
The council finally chose the fire department parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - apparently, too many factors were against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, it was all turned around again.
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg school.
Regarding the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
Then, city council has the last word.
He assumes a decision will be reached this year, so that park can be built in 2019.
Bottlenecks in air traffic control are getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting European air traffic in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
This year it was only wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and the storm will hit after that, head of the German air traffic union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
He said that the well known staff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers are an important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations and that there is no quick fix to this problem.
Airlines and airports can make quick improvements for the coming year, but training new air traffic controllers takes four to five years, the unionist said.
He added that there are hardly any fully trained air traffic controllers available on the European market.
He pointed out that the Karlsruhe center monitoring Germany’s upper air space alone is short of some one hundred staff.
Maas again criticized the fact that different air transport trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives from federal and state governments, air traffic controllers, the airlines, and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.
If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, that will not work without us, said the head of the German air traffic union, many members of which work for the federally owned German air traffic control company DFS.
Maas again held the EU Commission’s guidelines responsible for the air traffic control predicament.
He asserted that traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air traffic control services now have a severe impact on daily operations, he stressed.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to promote regulations in Brussels that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers of oxygen".
He cautioned that, as things stand, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening is to be expected.
According to Maas, the EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they have sown in recent years, said Maas.
He hopes that the high costs incurred by the airlines as a result of delays will lead them to think again.
The German air traffic union would work to improve the situation only if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented training and education," said Maas.
He further noted that the previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related personnel reductions.
It does not yet address the necessary staff expansion.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favor of the plans for the reorganization of the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim head, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed to the meeting on Sunday for the management board, the crisis-hit group will be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will have their registered office in Essen and will be listed on the stock exchange.
There will be no further downsizing in addition to the reductions already known about.
After two withdrawals, the supervisory body only has eight heads on the capital side.
And there are ten employee representatives.
The final decision will be made in a general meeting planned in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to hold a 50-percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to be bundled with the elevator and subcontracting business.
Barcelona: Police brutality and violent Catalan independence activists at demonstrations.
Violent clashes by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona with numerous casualties at two concurrent demonstrations.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence activists demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protesting groups away from each other.
According to deployment forces, advocates for independence again tried to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and thrown objects.
Brawls between the participants of the two protesting groups were also reported.
24 people were injured according to the rescue forces.
The police stated there have been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central government.
They demanded better salaries at the same time.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil thought it was unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers were earning much more than they were.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
Why did they come here to protest? The 55-year old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Simply to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they worked us over a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who said his name is Daniel, rejected the accusation.
Of course we want to support our comrades who were only doing their job a year ago: defending the law, he said.
But the demonstration is here to enforce our rights and we're doing it in Barcelona, because it is a major European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues did “not come here to provoke,” the policeman ensured us.
Crash allowed access to personal data of British minister
A security hole in a mobile app led to the personal data of ministers and representatives of the Conservative British Tory party on Saturday being temporarily accessible to anyone.
According to British media reports, many ministers received calls from unknowns after the crash, one day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people clamped on B217
On Sunday morning the Hanover police reported a heavy traffic accident on the federal highway 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the outskirts of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died after driving their car into a tree.
Currently, the car is in flames.
Emergency services are at the scene.

Football: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ronaldo’s best game
The Portuguese star striker ‘this evening played the best game in addition to Valencia’s half hour’, commended Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star without scoring himself was the decisive man of the match in the important game against the pursuers.
Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well, said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal and we just got better from then onwards.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three assists, Juve struck back in the game after being down early through the goal by Dries Mertens (10th Minute) and in the thick of things the pursuer was put off for the time being.
The goal-getter brought in from Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double score (26./49.) for the lead.
And Ronaldo provided the build-up with a head ball from a corner shot, for the goal by the defence leader Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to make a short push in, in front of the goal line.
He gives a lot, said the trainer.
But naturally Allegri will also see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team.
We have to get better at serving him, the coach said.
Currently Mandzukic is the best Juve scorer with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
The superiority of Juventus seems even more overwhelming, with the purchase of Ronaldo, for more than 100 million Euros.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Series A. With 21 points the masters over the past seven years already have a six-point lead over Napoli.
The second team in the table, coached by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chances against Turin.
The top match was however decided at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58.).
The Portuguese after a too strong pile in against Paulo Dybala had to leave the field with a yellow-red.
We played well against a good Napoli, the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can should also feel addressed.
The German national has asserted himself at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool, participated in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which is what Allegri meant by the ‘half hour’: Ronaldo was sent off at the 2:0 Turin win and is barred for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
On the weekend, with a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused raised eyebrows and questions among the spectators.
On time for the release of his new album, the 41 year old additionally announced a name change.
From now on, one may call him only "Ye", so the musician.
The artist, formerly known as Kanye West, twittered in the style of the dead singer Prince, when he changed his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album has appeared under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL the artist explains that ‘Ye’ has a religious significance for him.
I think ‘Ye’ is the most frequently used word in the bible and means ‘you’, the rapper said.
Football: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar’s trainer Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game by us today.
The opponent was just easier to grip, we have almost never faced problems." Accordingly thin reads the list of Hoetmarer bullet options.
Just two scoring chances in 90 minutes. Not a good chance for a positive outcome.
Football District League A1: SC Hoetmar and SG Sendenhorst played 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG had only two options in the first round, but Maik Krause used the first from an acute angle to secure the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have upped the score, but after great preparation work by Krause he missed the ball.
The hosts had only a double opportunity as Moritz Höne failed and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper Jos Schuhmacher.
After halftime, the guests were even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (minute 49), Julian Turl (minute 61) and Heinz Linnemann (minute 69) all failed.
A hand penalty - Louis Kortenjann had rescued on the goal line with the hand and got the red card - was also not of use for the guests (minute 75).
Only once Nils Berheide poked the ball across the line was the game over (81st minute).
We had previously criticized ourselves hard, that was different today than in the last few weeks, was Florian Kraus’ conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th minute Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th minute (Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0-1 Krause (minute 7), 0-2 Berheide (minute 81).
Red card: Kortenjann (minute 75/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh falls against Concordia 3-4
I do not know what to think of that, he struggled for words.
We did not get any access to them. With ‘them’, he allegedly meant the wing players Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green and whites, who made themselves noticeable with their collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A filthy win," he said, winking cheekily and then went off. His players, on the other hand, were relieved to have gotten away with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for staying in the league.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes.
That was by far our best performance of the season, he says.
It was phenomenal how we come back from the 0-2 draw and held up against one of the league's top teams over the entire match.
Hence, the more bitter it seems, that they had to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner shot his team in the lead with his 12th. Goal this season (minute 24).
He needed exactly two touches in this game for this goal.
The 2-0, he set for Fabian Fröhning (minute 39).
We knew it, but you just can't completely take out a player like that.
It was amazing what he did, Lewandowski ungrudingly recognized the opponent’s quality.
Just before switching sides, his own team managed to score the equalizer: McGill’s free kick from the left side sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th minute).
After switching sides, it was McGill again who scored the equalizer (59th minute).
And then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten (minute 64), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized again (minute 69).
Despite their numerical advantage, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (minute 80).
Now, we must focus on Wednesday.
The game against Schapdetten, that’s one we have to win now, said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th minute Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th minute Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (minute 24), 2-0 Fröhning (minute 39), 2-1 McGill (minute 45), 2-2 McGill (minute 59), 3-2 Nübel (minute 64), 3-3 P. Horstmann (minute 69), 4-3 Jülkenbeck (minute 80).
Indirect Red: Atalan (minute 74/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins one point against Primus
There was no winner in the soccer league Landesliga dual between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The league leaders had actually come for three points, but Oliver Pfaff’s team was very good and ended the game 0-0.
Media: Dynamo Dresden’s entire executive board have resigned
The entire executive board of second division football club Dynamo Dresden have resigned according to media reports.
In the evening several media outlets consistently referred to a joint written statement from the club’s board.
The club did not provide a confirmation at first.
Internal power struggles inside the former Bundesliga club are cited as reasons for the step.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pageantry
Good that he’s gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure creates as great a sense of relief in Germany as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days and many thought he should never have been invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
Until the middle of the following year the Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has shown interest to personally claim the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: As Federal President he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff has been as a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him in when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have visited us". That celebrities appear again and again at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter, Konstantin Wecker took part in a session about spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann will be at a session about his Grandfather Thomas Mann.
France’s President Emmanuel has also confirmed: He wants to accept the “Prize for Tolerance” awarded to him by the academy in Tutzing in person, the TV presenter Dunja Hayali is also receiving something in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 are with essence.
The pension is not even safe! says a conference title.
SOS at Europe’s borders - this is how the Academy describes the ‘risky and fatal route across the Mediterranean’.
And a conference about Syria: Barbarism without limit’.
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war makes a mockery of the humane’.
The spectrum of events extends from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor as well as to the radical change of work through digitisation.
Academy Director, Hahn was not convinced: ‘A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together, to look for solutions or at least partial solutions’.
Soon at a conference celebrating the 200th
birthday of Karl Marx, some will be awaiting more visitors in the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others more likely a tendency "from left to centre".
What about neutrality?
We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the evangelical national church, said Director of Studies, Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, ‘but we are not 100 percent neutral’.
Satirical revue: Gender communication from the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
Tina Teubner’s satirical revue Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for adults as well as men".
Comedian Teubner honed in on gender communication with humor and empathy for the (stereotypical) woman and the (stereotypical) man - and anything else that out there - but also with music.
They played mini guitar and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süverkrüp was manning the piano.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner congenially and in harmony, so much so that some may have wished a solo.
Then there was this, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, so as to fit the theme of the evening.
Teubner had introduced a paradox: She mused that a man is happy when he has a partner but does not hold the door open for her.
But that a closed door without a partner, on the other hand, offers no benefit.
The piano solo demonstrated this very notion: How would Mozart’s career as a composer turned out, if his older sister "the Nannerl" had suddenly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bach’s "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Death Rattle" Western theme, and from Mozart’s G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and shouts of "bravo" from the packed hall.
The association’s treasurer, Karlheinz Kleintje, presented flowers to the singer.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck refused to part without offering additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to a gig in Wolbeck in addition to their appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The SEC accused Musk of publishing false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
Following a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have amended the number of victims to a slightly lower figure.
10 instead of 15 passengers are now reported to have been slightly injured.
All are now said to have been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in hospital over night for observation.
It will be released over the day, a police spokesperson said.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is reportedly still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed into a guardrail on Saturday morning at full speed.
Handball: Women Division: Ahlener SG keeps a clean sheet against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen players especially had trouble with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals on her own.
I was actually pretty satisfied with the defense. Only one player scored too many goals.
We did not get that under control, said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
He was more annoyed by the many opportunities that were left on the table.
The focus at the end made his team miss the victory this time.
The ASG lagged behind until the break with 11:12 and later still with 15:18 (minute 45).
Towards the end, the broader bench of the hosts made a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu Rückraum put Merle Klement on the left wing, who then made "decisive goals in an extremely clever way" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: Top performance by BSV Ostbevern in the championship game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have established themselves again in the top group of the 3. League West.
On the home field of relegated club’s VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-white won with 3-1.
It was a huge step in a cool season.
It’s so much fun to play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have been working towards, says trainer Dominik Münch excitedly after an almost flawless performance by his team at the now defeated table leader.
In the first part, the guests dominated almost however they wanted.
With 4-1, 16-10 and 22-12, the runner-up of the previous year won with a 25-15.
Essen played with two lines, but has not come into play.
We kept them on their toes.
Our opponent struck with a high risk, but also produced countless penalty cards.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12-8. "Essen changed to three lines.
We could not hold the pressure.
Essen moved in closer, and we let ourselves be lulled a bit," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were in front.
Although Ostbevern defended four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
The game was now in a better class, believes the trainer about the performance.
Maike Rüdingloh and then Wiebke Silge made huge contributions with their serves that BSV turned the page in the third set from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
At 7-3 and 15-13, the blue-white added part four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an outstanding day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea und Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib Mosque was opened in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can be put together only with difficulty, said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German side missed the opportunity to have a joint reconciliatory appearance.
Instead of highlighting the Muslims’ affiliation with Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the event for his own purposes, complained Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had encouraged "many reservations."
Nottuln Home Association: The offer has already been established
It’s Folk Festival time again finally after the long summer break
On October 18th (Thursday) at 19:30, the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the old Amtmannei.
It’s almost exactly a year to the day since we met here for a Folk Festival for the first time.
This event has now become a fixture in the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln Home Association, pleased.
I would not have thought that our Folktreff got established so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was the storm Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the ‘Amtmannei’ was always full.
As always, the program for the next Folk Festival is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, evergreens an old hits, says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always inviting musical friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised to play his accordion for the first Folk Festival “birthday.”
He was a member of “Gaitling” many years ago, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's a member of an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folk Festival fondly remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schultz from the Folk Festival Emsdetten excited the audience with his international version of the song “Frogs in the Night” and sent them home with the song stuck in their heads.
We are expecting many happy guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening together, says the invitation from the Home Association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join in.
Since the coveted seats are always taken quickly, it’s recommended to get there early enough.
The Folk Festival will start at 7:30 pm, but admission begins at 7 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons all open questions must be clarified by October 24.
Frankfurt Linde and Praxair are one step further to becoming the world’s largest industrial gases company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that only the authorisations from South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are still outstanding for the multi-billion dollar merger.
The chances of the approval of an insider has improved recently as a result, because Linde has confirmed the sale of additional company parts.
All outstanding issues must be resolved by October 24th for legal reasons, for the merger to succeed.
From clean fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation was celebrated with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the association celebrated the big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frankly the association had a different name at that time: In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (District Fruit Growing Association Kulmbach City and Country).
The purpose of the fruit-growing association differed from that of today’s work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite, explained the local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees lined the highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Today fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 members.
But by far that is not the end of the scope.
Gardening close to nature, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge about healthy diets and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" (moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.
Youth work is critically important, especially in the digital age, said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also emphasised how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was for us as children a huge thing, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. it is possible to collect a similar quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner .
Where the trees will be planted will be decided by the district association, added district administrator Söllner and emphasised the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, was also stated without doubt by the county manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about the long history of the district association and reported among other things, how necessary self-sufficiency was after the war.
In the old days everything came from the garden, for the winter conserves were made.
At the end of the 50s, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and live-in garden.
Nature endures, it existed before us and we must adapt ourselves to it, pleaded the specialist in fruit and nut trees.
There is an incentive therefore for the gardening associations not to give up, so that our country remains beautiful and worth living.
Also involved is the welcoming of new citizens to our associations, explained the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren, Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was festively framed by the tower brass musicians of the Thurnau music association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada’s foreign minister reschedules UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity in Nafta issues: Both trading partners are set an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister is now giving trading agreements absolute priority - and is delaying her speech for the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure involved in the struggle for a new edition of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, the Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate in New York.
Instead of today, Saturday, the minister will not speak before the United Nations general assembly until Monday, shared her spokesperson Adam Austen.
In the meantime she will concentrate on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday the Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo explained that Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement that had already been made between his country and the USA.
In August the USA and Mexico agreed on a new version of the regional Nafta free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in future.
The talks concerning revision have been ongoing for over a year.
They will have concluded by Sunday evening (local time) and Trump’s government will submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
On Friday Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced that should the negotiations fail then Mexico would attempt achieving a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has been released from the hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to his hometown Río de Janeiro.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will attend any events in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the street in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (English: "Not him"), especially women's associations protested against the ex-military.
The associations also took to social media to protest against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic hub São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of former president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presidency.
The presidential election in Brazil will be on October 7.
As the former mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro according to polls.
The “Trump of Brazil” has been in politics for a long time, but only recently has presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff election on October 28th.
Experts assume that Bolsonaro will not be victorious - no matter who he is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for being against gay and black people and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks the people of Brazil with verbal derailments over and over again.
Once he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Labor Party should be shot dead.

Following a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 following a long illness, shared his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen’s website.
Larsen was surrounded on his deathbed by his wife and six children.
Since the beginning of the year the musician had been under treatment for prostate cancer.
Larsen became famous with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, after the dissolution of the band, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in everyone’s hearts."
The head of government also recalled that in the year 2010 the monarchy opponent Larsen performed on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
A night of rock in the shoe factory: Loud as a jackhammer
Here we stand, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the strength of a tiger. The band names Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw and The Ignition alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music event on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, the community center housed in an old shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who are also friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians take time for a group photo.
There is no hint of stage fright in the process.
Afterwards, the lead singers and their bands from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosquito booking agency from Oelde - visibly enthrall the approximately 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito rock night with their loud performances.
Kicking things off, the Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with their latest, unknown pieces, which the band penned themselves for their soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, people dance to the powerful yet harmonious band performance.
Despite loud calls for an encore, Tiger Bonesaw then hand over the reigns to the three-member Here We Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate the variety within hard rock with their alternative sound, which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Following the high energy rock of the Tigers, Here We Stand adds a synthesizer on top of the guitar sound.
Among other titles, the yearning, almost ballad-like Take Me Home captivates the audience by switching between melodic passages and the guitar-heavy rock reefs typical of the multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a special reputation since the band formed in 2005.
The band presented their full-energy hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that The Ignition have a great deal of stage experience from their performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour.
Playing off his band, Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann has his very own take on the evening’s only cover - Word Up by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, it feels like the volume is dialed up even higher than before as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a solo while running through the cheering crowd.
Of course, when it comes to hard rock concerts, a certain decibel level has to be expected: According to the sound crew, that level was around 98 decibels for the three band concert with Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition during the Mint Mosquito night of rock.
That is approximately the same level as a jackhammer, which is still significantly lower than the peak volumes at Wacken Open Air festival referenced on the band website of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience has no need during this night of rock for 120 decibel sound as loud as a jet engine, as is common at the heavy metal get together in the north of Germany.
After just under four hours, the three hard rock bands have long since won the audience over with their confident, expert performance and own songs.
In the end, all three bands can honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stand, having taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the strength of a tiger."
Above all, they enjoyed the plentiful applause from the audience.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen airport.
On Sunday a glider crashed into the parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Close to Mülheim/Essen airport a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the ‘Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung’, a glider crashed into the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was reportedly killed.
The WAZ further reported that the student pilot was alone on board - the aircraft was apparently a one-seater.
According to reports, the aircraft had already been on its landing approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is not far from a marquee within airport premises.
However, starting this weekend, an Oktoberfest is being held.
The Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the ramp to highway 52.
During large events at the Essen conference center or the city’s Grugahalle venue, a park and ride service is offered from the parking lot.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President is well disposed towards North Korea’s ruler Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
This is also linked to Kim’s ‘wonderful letters’.
At the tender age of 72 years, the married US president has a new flame.
The tragic thing is: It is a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, in total public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Supporters in the US federal state of West Virginia have heard tender words from Trump for the descendant from the ruling dynasty of Pyongyang half his age, although the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is proving to be a particularly tough job.
I was tough and so was he, it went backwards and forwards between us, reported Trump.
Then we fell in love.
OK?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also bore fruit politically: Trump pointed to Kim’s announced to halt all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics say it is mere cheap talk.
The US president seemed to be fully aware, that not everyone was fond of the affection for the notorious martial threats of the "Rocket Man" - so Trump’s nickname for Kim.
He accepted the expected criticism during his appearance at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: ‘Donald Trump says, they have fallen in love’.
How terrible, how terrible is this?
That is so unpresidential.
He cared little for that, said Trump, pointing his finger at the crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy to be presidential."
But 10,000 people outside would not be surging into this packed arena, we would only have 200 people standing outside.
The Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler was very well-attended, with a great atmosphere and plenty of sunshine: Very diversified and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweilers city dressed up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not just held in the marquee at the Feuerwehr tower, but on Sunday was extended into the city by the trade association.
Thanks to video from Libyan prison, refugees are rescued
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya which has made it possible for them to be rescued.
At the risk of their lives, the group had shot the video in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.
They refuse to send us back, said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here. We are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website “France 24 Observers,” whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were ultimately flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
Without the video, we likely would not have been able to return to Nigeria, said Efe Onyeka, who made the video, according to the news agency AFP.
The 25-year old was arrested in Libya when attempting to make her way into Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he said he risked his own life.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions in jail were catastrophic; “They beat all of us with pipes and sticks.”
They didn't give us anything to eat. We had to drink out of the latrine.
The IOM organized the voluntary repatriation of the refugees who were stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home in the West African country this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo.
Given the poor conditions in Libya, this case of the now rescued Nigerians is no exception.
However, a call for help via mobile phone video was new to them.
International organizations are criticizing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African country, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main country of passage for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.

Around 16:50 the teacher entered the building by the main entrance.
In the entrance hall of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately ran away.
First through a door, then across the roof terrace, a staircase on the ground floor and the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who started investigations.
It is not possible to say whether items or money were stolen.
Witness description: about 16 years old, black, short-haired, dark appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.

A German was trapped in his automobile for days
A 75 year old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forested area in Middle Franconia, after his car got stuck away from all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon rescue workers accidentally discovered the car near a meadow and freed the person considered missing since Tuesday evening, the police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was apparently found in a healthy conditions despite the cold nights and long period without supplies.
He said he is now pleased to be home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family, when on Tuesday he did not return from a journey in his SUV across local grassland and fields.
The whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days, despite intensive search efforts.
Laschet urges Turkey to act according to the rule of law
Cologne - According to the Minister President of NRW Armin Laschet (CDU), during his talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relationships of both countries are currently ‘overshadowed’, Laschet said on Saturday, following a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
These concerns are related to all the arrest waves, freedom of media and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that "if in the future relations are going to become normal and if economic relations are going to deepen, then the rule of law is a very important condition."
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans being imprisoned in Turkey.
He had expressed the hope that freedom of expression would be respected.
Thereupon Erdogan once again underlined the independence of Turkish system of justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to the building of the Executive Transport Wing of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it should have taken place at Wahn castle - but the castle owners declined due to political views against Erdogan.
After the speech Erdogan went to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet declined a joint appearance in the building.
He did say though: ‘The Muslims who go to this mosque, are also citizens of our country’.
And we are their contact persons - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President, Trump does not tire of highlighting the success of negotiations over North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is describing relations more demurely.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concession from Washington.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the UN General Debate, has accused the US government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through continued sanctions.
The recent standstill has seen the US implementing coercive measures, which are lethal to trust-building, said Ri in New York.
Disarmament under these circumstance would be unthinkable for North Korea.
Without any trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves first, the North Korean head diplomat said.
The idea that North Korea could be ‘brought to its knees’ due to the sanctions, is ‘a pipe dream of people who don’t know us’.
To build trust his country has stopped its atom and missile tests and has destroyed a nuclear test system, Ri said.
However, the USA has shown no "corresponding reactions" to that, the minister criticised.
Last year alone, because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council passed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.
In recent days the US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United Nations.
Concurrently, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met with North Korea’s ruler, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore the US President is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will be traveling to Pyongyang again for talks about the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors of the House of the Open Door (HoT) didn’t realise the fact that they were actually in a youth club: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
Youth from the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the youth wanted to express their thanks with the meal.
The start was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break, and we were well prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: A power outage had cut the power to the huge two-part refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be thrown out.
Now we had to start from the beginning again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and youth wanted to do it alone, says Westbuer.
And so everyone helped.
The result was impressive and the guests were excited.
Professional chefs could not do any better either, an impressed visitor said, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served and the guests enjoyed quiche, meatloaf or cake.
It is really great what the children and young people have put together, said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed the guests with card tricks and other performances.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW executive board of the Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his position.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Tafel had introduced a limit for foreigners.
He had resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW Tafel, said Sartor to the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many had stabbed me in the back.
The head of the NRW association of the Tafel, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding for the decision of his longtime deputy to dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism to heart.
I can understand his step - many people spoke up who did not even know exactly why the Essen Tafel does that.
But Sartor is still working for the Essener Tafel - “six days a week, nothing has changed about it,” says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues from other Tafel associations in "Welt am Sonntag.".
One should not think, "that without us, people in the city would be starving."
It would be the government’s obligation to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The man from Essen did not participate at a congress of the Tafel in Berlin on Friday.
They’re oversimplifying it all, he said.
There are all those do-gooders who criticized me so much back then.

The VfB Stuttgart also received its first victory.
The Stuttgarters had to take fear of the Werder Bremen, which already before the end of the first half-time had been reduced to a team of ten because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.

The Gladbachers, using the Swiss quartett line-up of Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave away the lead twice, but ultimately achieved a 2:2 score, which means that since the year 2003 they still await an away win in the VW city.
Renato Steffen was responsible for the 1:1 tie goal for Wolfsburg, which was his second goal in the Bundesliga.
The Aargauer Yann Sommer was powerless against the low shot from 20 metres, as well as against the second goal against an hour later.

Macedonians are to agree on a new state name
In Macedonia around 1.8 million citizens will today agree whether the name of their country in North Macedonia should be changed.
A yes could help settle the dispute with neighboring Greece that has been simmering for nearly three decades.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and sought to block any Macedonian advances to the West.
Voters are therefore also deciding on the country’s future integration into the West.
The USA have announced that the country could quickly become a Nato member if there is a positive outcome from the referendum.
Syrian detained awaiting trial.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three senior citizens partially causing severe injuries.
On Friday at about 22.00 the 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the policemen arrived, they questioned the accused about his behavior, who with clenched fists attempted to attack passers-by.
The Syrian thereafter tried to beat and kick the officials.
A short time later it turned out that the suspect had recently beaten three older ladies (aged 65, 67, 75) in the Währinger street, at a tram stop with his fists bringing them to the ground.
Additionally he stomped on the trio with his feet.
The senior citizens were partially seriously injured.
They suffered hematoma, bruising and concussion.
The police stated, the asylum seeker was also seriously injured, "through causes still requiring identification."
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout his treatment.
SPD Politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost a year after marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs previously told the ‘Bild’ newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not for them.
If we get married, we want to do it properly. He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs speaks on budgetary policy for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Seeheim region speakers of the conservative SPD wing.
Kahrs had caused quite a stir with an angry speech on June 30, 2017 during a parliamentary debate over allowing homosexuals to get married.
For example, he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
He felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to the inadvertent announcement of the East German border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017 same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality of status with marriage, for example concerning adoption laws.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedge trimmed
The members of the citizens’ association Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde were faced with a lot of work.
Because around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhause had to be trimmed.
Supported by the residents, about twelve helpers went to work.
We are doing this to reduce costs, explained the chairman of the citizens’ association Walter Schröer.
And a lot of costs have accumulated.
Because of the hot summer, we're late getting started, but fortunately it’s just some profile trimming.
Because they had already cut the hedge in the spring.
The breakfast that always follows the work also has a long tradition.
Everyone should eat to have enough energy, said Walter Schröer.
World championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner receives gold at the canoe slalom world championships
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the canoe slalom world championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old completed a perfect run on the Olympic stretch.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, having done plenty of runs on this setup, and today everything went perfectly’, said the Olympic bronze medalist from London 2012.
At the finish line, he threw away his paddle for joy and victoriously stretched both arms into the air - knowing that it would at least be enough for a medal.
After all, he started at number four.
Yet the six remaining starters could not top his best time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech, Jiri Prskavec came second in front of the Russian, Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspection announces the first attempted break-in this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the culprits failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars are taking advantage of this.
Yesterday the police station Gauting reported the first break-in attempt of this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm system that the attempt in the Königswieser Straße at the single family home remained as such.
On Friday just before 20.00 the alarm rang when the offenders took action.
The burglars assumed the inhabitants were not at home.
Yet apparently the alarm surprised them so much that they fled without loot.

The fall of Hertha: Overtaken by reality: Bayern calls for Ajax
The title of unbeatable is gone: The defeat in Berlin will not allow the FC Bayern to give up.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the interim conclusion for Niko Kovac’s tenure.
Under no circumstances should the first small drop in power with the new coach Niko Kovaca should increase for Munich to the autumn minimum.
A week ago, everyone still thought we were unbeatable.
Now we are overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hertha BSC and asks for a return leg in the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us, is aware that we are really angry and that is why we will crank up on Tuesday.
For the first time within more than a year of playing away there were scored no goals, as at the same time two mandatory preseason games in series without a victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not nearly as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the champions shall be aware.
The FC Augsburg with the 1:1 ratio having its long running man-on-man tactics and the Berlin through its playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered within two days two similar blueprints, as the last overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.
Those who know Bayern are aware that we will not put up with that and that we will do everything to become successful again, Kovac said.
Apart from this, he quietly bypassed his native city with his losers and put his first defeat as Munich coach down to the inadequate handling of opportunities.
A win over Amsterdam and Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before the international break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.
So before the second premier class appearance in this season after the 2-0 over Benfica Lisbon, Kovac undertook no extraordinary measures.
As it was planned, after the day off on Sunday started quick preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as well.
Now they’ve scored a victory over us in two games, but we will also reach our goals again, announced captain of the national team Manuel Neuer.
Already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at the same position the most notably in plain text spoke Joshua Kimmich.
The right defender take on the role of admonisher.
I do not believe that this is all bad luck, we need to work it out again, because we do not go for most of the opportunities and make mistakes, said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh match day of the previous season Bayern was even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over with one point ahead.
And so Kimmich appreciated only with a shrug of its shoulders at least positively, that now the public debate about supposedly invincible Bavaria has ended.
Yes, that’s good, said the national player.
It is a good thing for the league.
DFB boss comes under fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack of Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish president Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany amidst serious accusations.
The DFB president Grindel admits mistakes but upholds the association’s line.
Now will be created a new post.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özil dispute.
After the Turkish President criticized the speech of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head of DFB upheld the association’s line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, who had been personally attacked by Özil, reported on the consequences of the issue on the Mainz ZDF “Sport studio”.
As we have a lot of players with a migration background in the U teams, in future we must draw very specific conclusions, so something like this this does not happen again, said the 57-year-old and plans to get a national player without a migration background as an additional integration official.
Grindel also explained again that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
The latter was very critical of the racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this association because they allowed me to be photographed with them in England," said Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speaking, as their president, I could not accept the fact that our two young men, who had been risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, after the World Cup affair, which had been taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt that he was "reasonably treated by the DFB".
He also said he wanted to stand up for players in future.
That thing they say: If I win - I’m German, if I lose - I’m a migrant - that will not work.
I am very sorry that he had such an impression, said Grindel.
I’ve always said that we had to defend Mesut more.
Yet he does not see grounds for Özil to return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic of Cameroon ancestry, now should be appointed an additional integration representative.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says: The issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB President again next year.
I do my work and take care I do it as well as possible, Grindel said.
Elderly creates three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Roedental - As reported by the police, on Friday between the hours of 10 and 13, the 75 year old caused the accidents.
First, the 75 year old driver spoke with a lady at the red traffic light in the area of the Lauterer Höhe.
She informed the senior citizen that he had driven against her car.
No exchange of personal data occured as the 75 year old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later the police received a report by phone about an automobile driver who had come off the road and driven into a reflector post.
When asked, the man did not want the police on the scene and then drove off.
Afterwards the Rödental native drove home.
However, the retiree in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, got lost and while making a turn rammed a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car showed clear signs of damage from accidents.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and could not recall much.
The damages amounted to approx. 1 300 Euros.
Moorland Fire in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 forces on site.
About four weeks after the outbreak of moorland fires on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency forces are still busy with firefighting operations.
The federal armed forces announced this on Sunday.
70 volunteers were recently withdrawn since, according to a spokesman, the situation continues to be stable.
Also it was reported, that a further withdrawal of emergency forces is planned.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the state of emergency was lifted, which had been proclaimed a week earlier on September 21th, because it had been feared that the flames would spread by wind and flying sparks and thus endanger adjacent forests and settlements.
On thursday, it was reported that there is no longer a threat of the fire spreading to adjacent communities.
At times more than 1,500 deployment forces on site attempted to get the big fire under control.
The German Air Force used a transport helicopter to support the work on the German Federal Armed Forces test site near Meppen.
There are also reconnaissance flights with the Bundeswehr's drones.
According to the German Federal Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with “Tornadoes” are again planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was caused by test rockets, which the Airbus technicians had fired off.
The smoke draught of the moorland fires went up to a hundred kilometers far, even farther than the northwest of Germany, up to Bremen at times.
On Monday, the German Federal Armed Forces wants to set up a contact center to receive damage reports.
The first damage claims have already been announced by hoteliers and vacation home owners.
SPD Politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after marriage became available for everyone, the politician has married his longtime boyfriend in Hamburg.
The two have been together for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs previously told the “Bild” newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not for them.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the fiscal policy speaker for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Seeheim region speakers of the conservative SPD wing.
On June 30, 2017 Kahrs caused a huge stir about the opening of marriage to homosexuals in the Bundestag debate.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
He felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to the inadvertent announcement of the East German border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017 same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Before this they were able to register their civil partnership from 2001, but there was no equality in terms of marriage and the right to adopt.
Referendum over a new state name has begun in Macedonia
In Macedonia the eagerly anticipated referendum for a new name for this small Balkan state, has started.
About 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in future.
Neighboring Greece insists that it should due its eponymous northern province.
As a lever, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the starting signal for their country's integration into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the holocaust from oblivion

Switzerland is starting an electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent.
(dpa) Switzerland starts its electronic register for organ donation this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Those who want to donate their organs in cases of death, can register themselves.
Your wishes will then be available to Swisstransplant, if required.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent, as is the case in Germany.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have donor cards, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment when donating is possible.
In over 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the dead person’s intentions.
You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, according to their wish, which is often very stressful, says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, the recording of details about possible organ donation on the health card has been considered, as stated by the speaker for the Federal Office for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
There is no register where people can record their wishes, for or against organ donation, she says.
Federal Health Minister has spoken about new guidelines for organ donation.
According to his suggestion, everyone will be considered an organ donor, unless he/she or relatives contradict this.
Among others, the Catholic Church objects the proposed regulation.
14-year-old pupil is a world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old pupil Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in mental arithmetic.
On the weekend he defeated 39 competitors in Wolfsburg.
On Sunday the announcement was made by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest world champion participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese pupil, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as reported by head judge Ralf Laue.
Every two years the competition is organised by the computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony).
Examples of previous tasks included are: 14 130 214 x 17 981 822 or 57 809 355 + 28 x 16 448 333.
On Saturday afternoon there was a show where competitors competed against guests with calculators among the audience as spectators are not allowed to watch the competition.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he can keep a ball in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries, tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years ago Grüß as a 14 year old, at the time, was present in Bielefeld.
With terms like super brain, genius or prodigy, the organiser Laue can do little with.
It is possible to train in mental arithmetic, he said.
Many participants trained several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computing competitions set up in stadiums.
Square root extraction from six-digit numbers, for example, is also included in the disciplines.
In the various calculations, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they need to find a solution strategy.
The main judge said the Germans also had a good chance.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage as already in early childhood mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It’s all about early detection of breast cancer
Tennis star Serena Williams shows her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and speak up for its early diagnosing.
It is about life and death, but also courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up the song "I Touch Myself" of the group "The Divinyls" topless with only hands covering her most intimate parts.
The singer, Chrissy Amphlett, died because of it.
The emotional video is part of the ‘I Touch Myself’ project, about how the early recognition of breast cancer, can save lives.
Serena Williams herself could have died a year ago.
There were some complications when she was giving birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia.
To save the baby’s life an emergency surgery was started.
In a subsequent CT in Serena’s lung were discovered blood clots.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to extend the ban on using extremist symbols.
Next week the turquoise blue coalition is sending a relevant draft legislation on the so-called “Symbol Law" for appraisal.
As a result, there will be an obvious increase in the number of terrorist or comparable groups, caught by this ban.
Cold polar air is bringing fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will be shaking out her beds for the first time in the west next week: Cold polar air will reach the Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg regions on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow fall limit sinks to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - it was reported, that in narrow valleys, there might be intense snowfalls to about 1,000 meters.
20 to 40 cm of fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 meters from the Bregenz Forest to the High Tauern mountain range.
Therefore, road conditions on higher mountain pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) may be wintry.
On Monday farmers are allowed to start the annual hedge bank maintainance
On Monday Schleswig-Holstein farmers can start with the annual hedge bank maintainance.
For around 200 years, the "green ramparts" which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, up to five meters wide, are ‘forest replacements’ and for many animals and plants are the last areas of retreat.
Hedge banks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the executive director of the Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedge banks are living fences
In the year 1766 the hedge banks were created at the command of the Danish King Christian VI who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The ‘living fences’ were not just field boundaries and cattle fencing, they also provided farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time comes the name "Knick": By "bending over" (Umknicken) the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU’s details they are used by approximately 7,000 animal species as an alternative habitat.
One kilometre of hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 different species and up to 30 pairs of birds may breed there.
The hedge banks can only fulfill their ecologically important role if they are maintained accordingly in the winter.
Otherwise, it is stunted to a sparse tree line, which causes not only losses in biodiversity but also in the windbreaking effect, said Ludwichowski.
The hedge bank maintenance, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, can only take place outside the breeding period or from October until March.
After the tsunami on Sulawesi an Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes the local situation on Sulawesi island following the earthquakes and tsunami in the interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND):
Were you on location when the tsunami took place?
No, I was in Jakarta on Java island at the time.
At the time of the earthquakes, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately returned to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I still had to drive for more than 20 hours by car after the flight as the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has opened the airport again, so aid supply can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which were completely destroyed.
Our ‘World Vision’ office is also destroyed, but we have set something up provisionally, where other people have also been accommodated.
Where are the people of Sulawesi living now?
Many ran to the surrounding hills, where they held out through fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where there is no access to water and food.
Many stopped in front of their houses with aftershocks still being experienced.
As many food shops and gas stations are completely shut, some people are stealing provisions and gasoline.
The public services have completely shut down and the national government is helping.
Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners are running around free, and searching for them is difficult.
There are still lots of bodies lying around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information flow on the island?
At the moment we have mobile reception, which did not work previously and we have been receiving information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other persons, not knowing if they are alive and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquake and were on the way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work correctly.
Do you have any information about this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear was given, many people thought ‘OK, no tsunami’, and then it came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was false information about a tsunami hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding hills.
An island like Sulawesi that sits on the Pacific rim of fire, is not prepared for earthquakes?
Yet there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We normally know how to react to an earthquake and are trained for evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries to Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missed for a long time in the VfB Stuttgart's line-up due to serious muscle injuries.
Aogo tore a muscle fiber in his rear left thigh during a 2:1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga soccer team announced on Sunday.
Donis was diagnosed with a torn muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably also miss matches after the international cap break.
A downtime forecast was not given by VfB Stuttgart.
A torn muscle bundle usually heals within six to eight weeks, a torn muscle fibre usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at San Sebástian film festival
San Sebastián - Each year, the Film Festival of San Sebastián closes the season of Europe’s most prestigious festivals.
Despite all the talk of cinema’s demise one can summarize: 2018 was a remarkable year for the movies.
After an impressive contest in Cannes, with particularly strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a festival in Venice, which attracted much attention for its Oscar hopefuls from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the operation took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning walkers along the Olchinger See noticed a white, injured duck.
It stopped in the area of the water safety station.
Passers-by called the police and fire department to help the animal.
The first attempts to catch the duck went wrong however.
Despite its injury, it continued to dodge the emergency services.
In the end the duck fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could circle the animal and push it back ashore, where after almost an hour it was then put in a transport box with a courageous grip by a firefighter.
The duck, with an injured breast, was then taken to the LMU’s animal hospital in Oberschleißheim.
However, initial assessments revealed that its chances of surviving were fairly low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for the World Championship medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was sad for a long time about fourth place at the Olympics.
In the coming winter, the Saalfelden native wants to catch up on the missed medal at the world championship in Östersund.
The 31 year old’s last shot cost him the medal that was within his grasp in the Olympic sprint at Pyeonchang.
Seven tenths of a second cost him the bronze in the end.
I deliberately gave myself time to process this, says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
My goal was to win a medal. I was in peak form, but it just wasn’t to be.
The Pinzgau region native is all the more motivated to catch up on the missed medal in the new season: "The goal can only be to go to a major event to win something.
At some point you have to win.
The world championship cross-country ski run in Östersund, Sweden is Eberhard's: “I have already taken the track to heart,” he says as he happily remembers his fourth place world cup finish in the individual race last year.
Right after the Olympics, he celebrated Austria’s only individual victory in the last world cup winter in the mass start competition in Kontiolahti, Finland.
In Oslo (NOR), he managed second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: High-speed FBI investigation
Time is extremely tight and the number of planned interrogations is very restricted.
Republicans in the US Senate want the break-neck speed FBI investigation to help secure a majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become paper thin amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to clarify more than 30 years of suspected incidents from years back.
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination, which has involved a culture war, had been triggered on Friday.
After an 8-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer directed angry tirades at the opposition democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to pave the way for final confirmation of the ultra-sensitive judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake, against his original announcement, suddenly declared he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
Following tumultuous scenes his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described the bitter arguments on Thursday as a ‘scam’, then included further attacks against the women and spoke in contrast about a ‘blessing in disguise’.
He said that this way any lingering doubts could be eliminated.
Later, Trump attacked Democrats sharply at a rally because they opposed Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump is ordering an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely narrowed the powers of the investigators.
They will focus on investigating the known allegations by two women, nothing more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They will not be going on a fishing trip."
According to the ‘New York Times’ only four witnesses will be heard.
As of Monday October 1st the mobile radar unit installed in a "civil vehicle", that keeps watch over speed limits in the borough of Ried was located to the Gartenstraße, according to the municipality.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality has been operating multiple permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after defeating Mainz: You could feel the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
There is a great sense of relief at Schalke after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, time was also a factor against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, Christian Heidel is well-known for being a huge pessimist at football matches.
The home game against Mainz 05 was no different.
I saw every ball going in.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the "royal blues" had managed to seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz over the course of the match and thus celebrated the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have been very different.
After Alessandro Schöpf (11th) had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco the lead and therefore security, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both in terms of how we played and in terms of pressing". As the match continued, mental strength became increasingly important.
Schöpf is usually not an aerial threat
The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me, said Heidel: ‘I can understand if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench’.
The boys were afraid to squander the lead and therefore kept retreating.
And threw everything they had into our defense.
To hold on to the first three points of the season.
We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: "And I am actually the worst header on the team."
But in the end, victory is all that counts.
The relief was felt throughout the entire arena, not least by Tedesco.
We wanted to start strong in the early stages and make a firework of it, said Schalke’s head coach.
The win was an important one.
Finally we can enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, calmly and with courage, that is how we must approach matches over 90 minutes
The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: The "Royal Blues" missed their chance to establish control over the match early.
After all, they did get their chances, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) or Amine Harit (62nd).
That way it would not have been such a nerve wrecking victory, said Tedesco: "You really could feel the fear a little bit."
So I am glad that we won.
He was not the only one at Schalke.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal visible from 2 km
The smoke was hard to miss.
On Sunday at around 13.30, at a distance of approximately two kilometres a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire.
The police are now investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and fire departments: A stranger had set fire to garbage on a two square meter area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appears the fire was monitored for a long time, but the embers were inadvertently left behind.
Close to the forest too.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were tasked with dispersing and extinguishing it.
The police now think it is a case of arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani is standing before them.
He has once again accepted the invitation from Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
For many year, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven, explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.
El-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he introduces the audience to one of the most contentious topics: Migration and integration.
Why are there increasingly conflicts, despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
The German society sits at the big table, the migrants of the first generation at the kid’s table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany. They always sat at the big table and now want to have a say too.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not of importance whether one is politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then the discussion round gets more and more lively.
And there is a need for discussion.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, and two teachers explain how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front of the stage, not on it, symbolizing the discussion: It is a discussion at eye level.
The sociology professor does not force his opinion onto the audience, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is happy that people are interested in the topic, because “we can only find a solution once we understand what the problem is,” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the guests’ questions and the discussion continued in the foyer over Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers und the Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first match day of Bundesliga Basketball (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Gießen won through in a very competitive game on its own court scoring 91:84 (43:46) against Mitteldeutscher BC.
The ambitious team from Bonn won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
Alba Berlin are the fist team at the top of the table this season after their 112: 55 thumping on Saturday of Science City Jena.
German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg, by contrast, had more of an uphill battle at the beginning of the new season.
Munich fought to a hard-won 83:77 on Friday at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the "Frankenderby" on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The demand is obviously huge: Over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in South Landsham.
The Pliening community sold the first properties in the South Landsham development area on the open market.
This was reported by the mayor Roland Frick.
Anyway the application phase for each of the 20 properties, which the municipality is offering at better conditions and prices - similar to the earlier local model, has now ended.
At least 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
At present, the documents are being reviewed with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal by the end of the year is to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots of land ready for submission to the local council.
After that the awarding of the plots can follow.
In the area to the south of Landsham a total of 50 single-family and semi-detached properties will be created, including four areas for apartment blocks earmarked for eight residential units.
The development is practically completed, only the streets and pathways now need to be asphalted.
A single plot and two for apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
The municipality sells the bulk of the plots on the open market, 20 plots according to the socially responsible model.
The two multi-family houses of the borough are to be built according to Frick as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented flats subsidised by the Free State.
Room for 200 people
Roughly estimated, there will be space for about 200 people within the properties of the developing area of Landsham-Süd.
Not only this: At the start of October, Frick says the new construction of a daycare center will begin.
This will accommodate three kindergarten and three toddler groups, including a multipurpose room.
The opening is planned for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This way, Schalke player Naldo is also a great athlete on the bench
Not in the starting lineup for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues has not been in the Schalke starting line-up for the third time in a row, many people would have understood it if the almost two-meters-tall Brazilian player had got his frustration off his chest.
But when the Schalke players gathered after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 in the center circle as usual and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his players, the 36-year-old nicknamed Naldo stepped in and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
That was very emotional, he is such a great sport, Tedesco said later about the reaction of his vice-captain, who holds no grudge despite his seat on the bench.
Naldo, who was awarded best Schalke player last season, probably knows that he is actually not going to be stuck on the bench - he does have a good reason for this break.
A reason called “load control.”
It was not easy to tell him
It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you, Tedesco said when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.
He is an important player. He is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” said Tedesco as he justifies the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can catch their breath at the moment.
And that we keep everyone together, said Tedesco explaining the rotation, which has recently hit Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted wisely: by proving himself as a model team player on the bench.
Compared to the rest of the euro zone, the descending mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate further in August.
The purchasing managers index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Across Europe, however, Austria still has the third-best mood in Europe after Ireland and the Netherlands, stated the Markit Institute on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, putting the index below the growth indicating 50-counter mark for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Bottom were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but it fell more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.
However, the slightly eased downswing could mean that the worst is over, said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders to the eurozone have not fallen this much since November 2011.
That is why companies have cut back jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China in August fell more strongly than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The PMI figures are based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in terms of turnover, employment, warehousing and prices are recorded.
