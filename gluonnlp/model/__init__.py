r"""Module for pre-defined NLP models.

This module contains definitions for the following model architectures:
-  `AWD`_

You can construct a model with random weights by calling its constructor. Because NLP models
are tied to vocabularies, you can either specify a dataset name to load and use the vocabulary
of that dataset:

.. code-block:: python

    import gluonnlp as nlp
    awd, vocab = nlp.model.awd_lstm_lm_1150(dataset_name='wikitext-2')

or directly specify a vocabulary object:

.. code-block:: python

    awd, vocab = nlp.model.awd_lstm_lm_1150(None, vocab=custom_vocab)

We provide pre-trained models for all the listed models.
These models can constructed by passing ``pretrained=True``:

.. code-block:: python

    awd, vocab = nlp.model.awd_lstm_lm_1150(dataset_name='wikitext-2'
                                            pretrained=True)

.. _AWD: https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997

    """Returns a pre-defined model by name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the model.
    dataset_name : str or None, default 'wikitext-2'.
        The dataset name on which the pretrained model is trained.
        Options are 'wikitext-2'. If specified, then the returned vocabulary is extracted from
        the training set of the dataset.
        If None, then vocab is required, for specifying embedding weight size, and is directly
        returned.
    vocab : gluonnlp.Vocab or None, default None
        Vocabulary object to be used with the language model.
        Required when dataset_name is not specified.
    pretrained : bool, default False
        Whether to load the pretrained weights for model.
    ctx : Context, default CPU
        The context in which to load the pretrained weights.
    root : str, default '~/.mxnet/models'
        Location for keeping the model parameters.

    Returns
    -------
    HybridBlock
        The model.
