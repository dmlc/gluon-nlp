class ConvolutionalEncoder(gluon.HybridBlock):
    r"""Convolutional encoder.

    We implement the convolutional encoder proposed in the following work::

        @inproceedings{kim2016character,
         title={Character-Aware Neural Language Models.},
         author={Kim, Yoon and Jernite, Yacine and Sontag, David and Rush, Alexander M},
         booktitle={AAAI},
         pages={2741--2749},
         year={2016}
        }

    Parameters
    ----------
    embed_size : int, default 15
        The input dimension to the encoder.
        We set the default according to the original work's experiments
        on PTB dataset with Char-small model setting.
    num_filters: Tuple[int], default (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150)
        The output dimension for each convolutional layer according to the filter sizes,
        which are the number of the filters learned by the layers.
        We set the default according to the original work's experiments
        on PTB dataset with Char-small model setting.
    ngram_filter_sizes: Tuple[int], default (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
        The size of each convolutional layer,
        and len(ngram_filter_sizes) equals to the number of convolutional layers.
        We set the default according to the original work's experiments
        on PTB dataset with Char-small model setting.
    conv_layer_activation: str, default 'tanh'
        Activation function to be used after convolutional layer.
        If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
        (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        We set the default according to the original work's experiments
        on PTB dataset with Char-small model setting.
    num_highway: int, default '1'
        The number of layers of the Highway layer.
        We set the default according to the original work's experiments
        on PTB dataset with Char-small model setting.
    highway_layer_activation: str, default 'relu'
        Activation function to be used after highway layer.
        If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
        (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        We set the default according to the original work's experiments
        on PTB dataset with Char-small model setting.
    highway_bias : HighwayBias,
        default HighwayBias(nonlinear_transform_bias=0.0, transform_gate_bias=-2.0)
        The biases applied to the highway layer.
        We set the default according to the above original work.
    output_size: int, default None
        The output dimension after conducting the convolutions and max pooling,
        and applying highways, as well as linear projection.
