    r"""Returns a cache model using a pre-trained language model.

    We implement the neural cache language model proposed in the following work::

        @article{grave2016improving,
        title={Improving neural language models with a continuous cache},
        author={Grave, Edouard and Joulin, Armand and Usunier, Nicolas},
        journal={ICLR},
        year={2017}
        }

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the cache language model.
    dataset_name : str or None, default 'wikitext-2'.
        The dataset name on which the pretrained model is trained.
        Options are 'wikitext-2'. If specified, then the returned vocabulary is extracted from
        the training set of the dataset.
        If None, then vocab is required, for specifying embedding weight size, and is directly
        returned.
    window : int
        Size of cache window
    theta : float
        The scala controls the flatness of the cache distribution
        that predict the next word as shown below:

        .. math::

            p_{cache} \propto \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \mathbb{1}_{w=x_{i+1}} exp(\theta {h_t}^T h_i)

        where :math:`p_{cache}` is the cache distribution, :math:`\mathbb{1}` is
        the identity function, and :math:`h_i` is the output of timestep i.
    lambdas : float
        Linear scalar between only cache and vocab distribution, the formulation is as below:

        .. math::

            p = (1 - \lambda) p_{vocab} + \lambda p_{cache}

        where :math:`p_{vocab}` is the vocabulary distribution and :math:`p_{cache}`
        is the cache distribution.
    vocab : gluonnlp.Vocab or None, default None
        Vocabulary object to be used with the language model.
        Required when dataset_name is not specified.
    pretrained : bool, default False
        Whether to load the pretrained weights for model.
    ctx : Context, default CPU
        The context in which to load the pretrained weights.
    root : str, default '~/.mxnet/models'
        Location for keeping the pre-trained model parameters.

    Returns
    -------
    Block
        The model.
