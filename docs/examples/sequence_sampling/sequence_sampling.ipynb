    "Let's use `V` to denote the vocabulary size, and `T` to denote the sequence length. Given a language model, we can sample sequences according to the probability that they would occur according to our model. At each time step, a language model predicts the likelihood of each word occuring, given the context from prior time steps. The outputs at any time step can be any word from the vocabulary whose size is V and thus the number of all possible outcomes for a sequence of length T is thus V^T. \n",
    "\n",
    "While sometimes we might want to sample sentences according to their probability of occuring, at other times we want to find the sentences that *are most likely to occur*. This is especially true in the case of language translation where we don't just want to see *a* translation. We want the *best* translation. While finding the optimal outcome quickly becomes intractable as time step increases, there are still many ways to sample reasonably good sequences. GluonNLP provides two samplers for generating from a language model: `BeamSearchSampler` and `SequenceSampler`."

The size of this subset is called the *beam size*. Suppose the beam size is `K` and the output vocabulary size is `V`. When selecting the beams to keep, the beam search algorithm first predict all possible successor words from the previous `K` beams, each of which has `V` possible outputs. This becomes a total of `K*V` paths. Out of these `K*V` paths, beam search ranks them by their score keeping only the top `K` paths."
