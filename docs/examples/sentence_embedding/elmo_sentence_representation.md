# Extract Sentence Features with Pre-trained ELMo

While word embeddings have been shown to capture syntactic and semantic information of words as well as have become a standard component in many state-of-the-art NLP architectures, their context-free nature limits their ability to represent context-dependent information.
Peters et. al. proposed a deep contextualized word representation method, called Embeddings from Language Models, or ELMo for short [1].
This model is pre-trained with a self-supervising task called a bidirectional language model; they show that the representation from this model is powerful and improves the state-of-the-art performance on many tasks such as question-answer activities, natural language inference, semantic role labeling, coreference resolution, named-entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.

In this notebook, we will show how to leverage the model API in GluonNLP to automatically download the pre-trained ELMo model, and generate sentence representation with this model.

We will focus on:

1) how to process and transform data to be used with pre-trained ELMo model, and
2) how to load the pre-trained ELMo model, and use it to extract the representation from preprocessed data.

## Preparation

We start with the usual preparation like importing libraries and setting up the environment.

### Load MXNet and GluonNLP

```{.python .input}
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
import numpy as np
import io

import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import gluon
import gluonnlp as nlp
nlp.utils.check_version('0.7.0')
```

## Preprocess the data

The goal of pre-processing the data is to numericalize the text using the pre-processing steps that are consistent with training ELMo model.

The exact same vocabulary needs to be used so that the indices in model embedding matches the pre-trained model.
In this section, we will proceed with the following steps:

1) Loading a custom dataset
2) Tokenizing the dataset in the same way as training ELMo
3) Numericalizing the tokens on both words and characters using the provided `vocab`

### Loading the dataset

The first step is to create a dataset from existing data.
Here, we use a paragraph from [1] as our dataset, using the built-in [TextLineDataset](../../api/modules/data.rst#gluonnlp.data.TextLineDataset) class.
It's a dataset of 7 samples, each of which is a sentence.

```{.python .input}
elmo_intro = """
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ELMo representations work extremely well in practice.
We first show that they can be easily added to existing models for six diverse and challenging language understanding problems, including textual entailment, question answering and sentiment analysis.
The addition of ELMo representations alone significantly improves the state of the art in every case, including up to 20% relative error reductions.
For tasks where direct comparisons are possible, ELMo outperforms CoVe (McCann et al., 2017), which computes contextualized representations using a neural machine translation encoder.
Finally, an analysis of both ELMo and CoVe reveals that deep representations outperform those derived from just the top layer of an LSTM.
Our trained models and code are publicly available, and we expect that ELMo will provide similar gains for many other NLP problems.
"""

elmo_intro_file = 'elmo_intro.txt'
with io.open(elmo_intro_file, 'w', encoding='utf8') as f:
    f.write(elmo_intro)

dataset = nlp.data.TextLineDataset(elmo_intro_file, 'utf8')
print(len(dataset))
print(dataset[2]) # print an example sentence from the input data
```

### Transforming the dataset

Once we have the dataset that consists of sentences in raw text form, the next step is to transform
the dataset into the format that ELMo model knows and on which it was trained.

In our case, transforming the dataset consists of tokenization and numericalization.

#### Tokenization

The ELMo pre-trained models are trained on Google 1-Billion Words dataset, which was tokenized with the Moses Tokenizer.
In GluonNLP, using [SacreMosesTokenizer](../../api/modules/data.rst#gluonnlp.data.SacreMosesTokenizer) should do the trick.
Once tokenized, we can add markers, or tokens, for the beginning and end of sentences. BOS means beginning of sentence, and EOS means the end of a sentence.

```{.python .input}
tokenizer = nlp.data.SacreMosesTokenizer()
dataset = dataset.transform(tokenizer)
dataset = dataset.transform(lambda x: ['<bos>'] + x + ['<eos>'])
print(dataset[2]) # print the same tokenized sentence as above
```


#### Using Vocab from pre-trained ELMo

Numericalizing the dataset is as straightforward as using the ELMo-specific character-level
vocabulary as transformation. For details on ELMo's vocabulary, see
[ELMoCharVocab](../../api/modules/vocab.rst#gluonnlp.vocab.ELMoCharVocab).
We also calculate the length of each sentence in preparation for batching.

```{.python .input}
vocab = nlp.vocab.ELMoCharVocab()
dataset = dataset.transform(lambda x: (vocab[x], len(x)), lazy=False)
```

#### Creating the `DataLoader`

Now that the dataset is ready, loading it with the `DataLoader` is straightforward.
Here, we pad the first field to the maximum length, and append/stack the actual length of the sentence to form
batches.
The lengths will be used as a mask.
For more advanced usage examples of the DataLoader object, check out the
[Sentiment Analysis tutorial](../sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.ipynb).

```{.python .input}
batch_size = 2
dataset_batchify_fn = nlp.data.batchify.Tuple(nlp.data.batchify.Pad(pad_val=0),
                                              nlp.data.batchify.Stack())
data_loader = gluon.data.DataLoader(dataset,
                                    batch_size=batch_size,
                                    batchify_fn=dataset_batchify_fn)
```

## Loading the pre-trained ELMo model

Using the model API in GluonNLP, you can automatically download the pre-trained models simply by
calling get_model. The available options are:

1. elmo_2x1024_128_2048cnn_1xhighway
2. elmo_2x2048_256_2048cnn_1xhighway
3. elmo_2x4096_512_2048cnn_2xhighway

Note that the second field in get_model's return value is ELMo's vocabulary.
Since we already created an instance of it above, here we simply ignore this field.

```{.python .input}
elmo_bilm, _ = nlp.model.get_model('elmo_2x1024_128_2048cnn_1xhighway',
                                   dataset_name='gbw',
                                   pretrained=True,
                                   ctx=mx.cpu())
print(elmo_bilm)
```

## Putting everything together

Finally, now we feed the prepared data batch into the [ELMoBiLM](../../api/modules/model.rst#gluonnlp.model.ELMoBiLM) model.

```{.python .input}
def get_features(data, valid_lengths):
    length = data.shape[1]
    hidden_state = elmo_bilm.begin_state(mx.nd.zeros, batch_size=batch_size)
    mask = mx.nd.arange(length).expand_dims(0).broadcast_axes(axis=(0,), size=(batch_size,))
    mask = mask < valid_lengths.expand_dims(1).astype('float32')
    output, hidden_state = elmo_bilm(data, hidden_state, mask)
    return output

batch = next(iter(data_loader))
features = get_features(*batch)
print([x.shape for x in features])
```

## Conclusion and summary

In this tutorial, we show how to generate sentence representation from the ELMo model.
In GluonNLP, this can be done with just a few simple steps: reuse of the data transformation from ELMo for preprocessing the data, automatically downloading the pre-trained model, and feeding the transformed data into the model.
To see how to plug in the pre-trained models in your own model architecture and use fine-tuning to improve downstream tasks, check our [Sentiment Analysis tutorial](../sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.ipynb).
