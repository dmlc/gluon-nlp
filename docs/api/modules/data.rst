Public Datasets
---------------

Popular datasets for NLP tasks are provided in gluonnlp.
By default, all built-in datasets are automatically downloaded from public repo and
reside in ~/.mxnet/datasets/.


Language modeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`WikiText <https://blog.einstein.ai/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/>`_
is a popular language modeling dataset from Salesforce.
It is a collection of over 100 million tokens extracted from the set of verified Good and Featured articles on Wikipedia.
The dataset is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

`Google 1 Billion Words <https://github.com/ciprian-chelba/1-billion-word-language-modeling-benchmark/>`_
is a popular language modeling dataset.
It is a collection of over 0.8 billion tokens extracted from the WMT11 website.
The dataset is available under Apache License.

Text Classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`IMDB <http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/>`_ is a popular dataset for binary sentiment classification.
It provides a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, 25,000 for testing, and additional unlabeled data.

`MR <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/>`_ is a movie-review data set of 10,662 sentences labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarity (positive or negative).

`SST-1 <http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/>`_ is an extension of the MR data set. However, training/test splits are provided and labels are fine-grained (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative). The training and test data sets have 237,107 and 2,210 sentences respectively.

SST-2 is the same as SST-1 with neutral sentences removed and only binary sentiment polarity are considered: very positive is considered as positive, and very negative is considered as negative.

`SUBJ <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/>`_ is a Subjectivity data set for sentiment analysis. Sentences labeled with respect to their subjectivity status (subjective or objective).

`TREC <http://cogcomp.org/page/resource_view/49/>`_ is a movie-review data set of 10,000 sentences labeled with respect to their subjectivity status (subjective or objective).

CR is customer reviews of various products (cameras, MP3s etc.). Sentences are labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarities (positive or negative).

`MPQA <http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/>`_ is an opinion polarity detection subtask. Sentences are labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarities (positive or negative).

CoNLL Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `CoNLL <http://www.conll.org/previous-tasks>`_ datasets are from a series of annual
competitions held at the top tier conference of the same name. The conference is organized by SIGNLL.

These datasets include data for the shared tasks, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, chunking,
named entity recognition (NER), semantic role labeling (SRL), etc.

We provide built in support for CoNLL 2000 -- 2002, 2004, as well as the Universal Dependencies
dataset which is used in the 2017 and 2018 competitions.

Question Answering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) <https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/>`_ is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.
