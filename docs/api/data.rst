Public Datasets
---------------
Popular datasets for NLP tasks are provided in gluonnlp.
By default, all built-in datasets are automatically downloaded from public repo and
reside in ~/.mxnet/datasets/.

Sentiment Analysis: IMDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`IMDB <http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/>`_ is a popular dataset for binary sentiment classification.
It provides a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, 25,000 for testing, and additional unlabeled data.

Sentiment Analysis: MR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`MR <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/>`_ is a movie-review data set of 10,662 sentences labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarity (positive or negative).

    MR
    
Sentiment Analysis: SST_1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`SST-1 <http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/>`_ is an extension of the MR data set. However, training/test splits are provided and labels are fine-grained (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative). The training and test data sets have 237,107 and 2,210 sentences respectively.

    SST_1

Sentiment Analysis: SST_2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Same with SST-1, but neutral sentences are removed and only binary sentiment polarity are considered: very positive is considered as positive, and very negative is considered as negative.

    SST_2
    
Sentiment Analysis: SUBJ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`SUBJ <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/>`_ is a Subjectivity data set for sentiment analysis. Sentences labeled with respect to their subjectivity status (subjective or objective).

CoNLL Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `CoNLL <http://www.conll.org/previous-tasks>`_ datasets are from a series of annual
competitions held at the top tier conference of the same name. The conference is organized by SIGNLL.

These datasets include data for the shared tasks, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, chunking,
named entity recognition (NER), semantic role labeling (SRL), etc.

We provide built in support for CoNLL 2000 -- 2002, 2004, as well as the Universal Dependencies
dataset which is used in the 2017 and 2018 competitions.
